**Musselburgh**
The original swatchless hat pattern: a double-layered beanie with 4-point crown shaping. The multi-gauge pattern now includes 9 gauges, for yarn weights between light fingering and DK, and 6 sizes. 

Have a single skein of yarn you're not sure what to do with? Need something simple to keep your hands busy during zoom meetings? Looking for a gift that everyone will appreciate? Want to cast on right away without any prep? Cast on today, no swatching required, and discover for yourself why so many knitters have fallen in love with Musselburgh. 

In what is essentially a three step project you'll start with a centre-out cast-on and increase for the first crown; the next part is a beautifully meditative knit (perfect for those zoom calls!) of stockinette in the round; finally, you will finish off the hat by mirroring the initial shaping with decreases. This simple canvas is perfect for exploring your creativity through yarn choice, stripes or colour blocking. The hat is fully reversible, so working each half in a different colour or stripe sequence can turn it into two completely different hats in one.

905506,February Hat,Kate Gagnon Osborn,2.62,18.0,4.0,Textured Pattern (Chart),,"When thinking about what I wanted to do for my first contribution to the year of hats, I took a bunch of elements of knitting I really, really love - a folded brim, textured stitches, stripes, and a pom pom - and incorporated them all into the design. 

**Worthy of Note**
This hat begins with a [provisional cast on][1], then a deep folded brim is worked in a K1, P1 Ribbing. Once the ribbing is complete, the provisional cast on is unpicked and placed on a spare circular needle and the stitches are joined to created a [folded brim][2]. 

After the brim is complete, the body of the hat is worked in a texture stripe pattern from a chart. The chart is worked 4 times around. Decreases shape the crown and a pom pom completes the look.

*Please Note:* This is not a beginner pattern, but it is a great introduction to working from charts. Both the body of the hat and the crown decreases are worked from a chart.

After over 7000 Ravelry projects completed since publishing this hat in January 2008, I'm revising the pattern August 2015 as follows. 

1) The pattern is now available in the Ravelry pattern store so it's easier to get and you don't need to rely on the old PDF link from a hackable Wordpress blog.

2) There were some complaints from a few people that they couldn't get the leaves to stand up and twist, so I've made that section clearer, and tested it with someone who had never made the hat before. 

3) There's now a chart for the leaf section including the color strand section and the decreases to form the twisted leaves. There are still written instructions as well, and I think they're clearer, too.

4) General instructions for adapting for a toddler or child size are included.

5) I welcome translations (the previous pattern was translated into 5 languages) and a magic loop mod. If you'd like to share these, please message me and I'll incorporate these into the pattern on another revise.

634269,Copy.Cat C.C beanie,Emily Ingrid,2.26,,4.0,,,"While in Chicago on a trip, I saw three different people wearing the same style hat.  I noticed the first one because I stare at anything knit, whether machine-made or handmade.  When I saw the second one, I assumed it must be a coincidence.  But after I saw the third one, I turned to my husband and exclaimed, “I must knit that hat!”  Then when I went home for a visit and hung out with a hometown friend, she was wearing the same hat I saw in Chicago, and I nearly tore it off her head in excitement.  I obsessively analyzed it, counting stitches and rounds so I could faithfully replicate it.  Since then, I found out it's a popular slouchy beanie by Cheveux Corp (C.C).  The original hat has hundreds of positive reviews and appears to look good on anyone regardless of gender, age, face shape, and hairstyle (or lack thereof).  It is, in my opinion, the perfect unisex hat with the perfect amount of slouch!

EDIT: Due to multiple requests, this pattern has been updated with a note about converting this hat into a ""Messy Bun Beanie"" - but keep in mind, this hat is meant to be slightly slouchie, and Messy Bun Beanies are more form-fitting!

This is the pattern I know I can depend on for stash busting, wardrobe enhancing, or a quick gift for someone I love! Ideal for beginner brioche enthusiasts, this hat is knit from the bottom up in two color brioche and is totally reversible!

645417,Citrus Hat,Laura Treadway,1.86,,4.0,,125.0,"Called the Citrus Hat for the way the decreases create the appearance of a citrus fruit, this is a pretty basic hat pattern that works well with pretty much any yarn and can fit multiple head sizes. 

It looks great in handspun or commercial yarn, and in solid, semi-solid, or variegated colorways. The combination of knits and purls used throughout the hat means it is very accommodating of different head sizes and a good match for kids that keep growing. 

While the pattern is written for worsted-weight yarn, it’s easy to adjust for different yarn weights, and the pattern includes some helpful hints for yarn modifications. 

The pattern includes sizes for baby, toddler, child/teenager, small adult, and large adult hats.

A perfect jumping off point for beginner briochers to try on their newly acquired skills - this hat is great for any gender or age, and the color possibilities are infinite!

For instance, my 4 yr old, myself, and my husband (who has a rather large noggin) have all worn the middle size! Although, I would ideally knit the smallest size for my kids (ages 2 and 4), the middle size for myself, and the large for my husband.*

The March Hat is worked in the round from the brim up. The pattern begins with a Tubular Cast On. If you do not wish to use the tubular cast on method you may opt to begin by casting on 108 (120) sts, joining for working in the round, and then skipping to the Brim instructions.

**From designer:** Derived from [Beanie No. 212](/patterns/library/beanie-no-212)
Bucilla Yarn Booklet, Volume 318, dated 1940.

This hat pattern was probably knit at least a million times during World War II, and remains one of the most enduring hat designs. Watch a movie or television program which takes place during the winter months, and somewhere in each outdoor frame will be someone wearing this hat.

What makes Beanie No. 212 distinct is the unique pattern created on the crown of the hat as the crown is shaped. When the hat is knit with classic ribbing all the way to the crown, the ribbing creates a large star-shaped pattern. When the hat is knit with stockinette stitch all the way to the crown, three lines are created which converge at the top of the hat.

What keeps Beanie No. 212 so popular is the variety of patterns which can be included in the hat due to its 6-stitch panel construction. Within those 6-stitch panels, a wide variety of choices can be made to create a unique hat each time this pattern is knit.

For beginners, Beanie No. 212 requires no special skills and can be knit on straight needles.

The hat can be knit for small (medium, large) adult heads by using 96 (104, 112) stitches.

714001,Flat Hat,KnitCurio,1.65,4.0,1.0,Stockinette,200.0,"Originally designed for a 6th grade knitting club, this basic hat is great for those who are more comfortable using straight needles but would like to advance past scarves and rectangular shapes.

Yarn suggested for this pattern is worsted weight yarn.

Note: Because this hat is flat and will then be seamed, one additional stitch on each side is needed. If you would like to alter the size, increase or decrease in increments of 8 to keep the crown decrease even. The pattern already has the 2 additional stitches for seaming added into the count.

Techniques that are practiced in this project:
* Knit/Purl ribbing
* Increasing
* Decreasing
* Seaming

This is a hat that can be customized! Knit the ribbing longer for a folded brim or leave it short for a beanie design.

NOTES
When knitting the body of the hat, I found it helpful to separate each repeat (30 stitches) of the cable pattern with a stitch marker. (Just be sure to use a different color marker for the end of the round!) Alternatively, you could knit the whole hat on double pointed needles and put each repeat on its own double pointed needle.

885844,Head Sock,Amanda Steck,2.03,,4.0,,400.0,"I’m pretty sure I don’t need explain how handy it is to have a pattern for a basic ribbed hat.  You can make it as sassy or reserved as you want with your choice of yarn and the stretch means that you won’t finish and then find out it won’t fit.

My problem is always the decreases.  They **never** look as tidy as I want!  (Between you and me, my ssk’s are always wonky, no matter what I do to make them pretty…)  

In this hat, I think I have found the solution.  You don’t need to learn any fancy stitches, since the decreases are still done with k2tog’s and ssk’s *but* the final product is flipped inside out and you hide any wonkyness away.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While this pattern is written for fingering weight yarn, you can easily adapt for other gauges:

* Cast on must be a multiple of 16, so you could try 128 stitches with sport, 112 with DK, 96 with worsted, or 80 with bulky (since it's ribbed, shoot for a little too big rather than a little too small)

* Setup row then becomes: [P1, work in established rib for (total stitch count)/4 - 2 stitches, P1, pm] three times then continue in established pattern to BOR marker - will have four markers total with (total stitch count)/4 stitches between them  ",,967,890,4.87,"M, L",Fingering

The Midas Hat is provisionally cast on and knit in the round in stockinette, which,  I think, really showcases beautifully dyed yarn.  It features a folded brim to maintain the clean, all stockinette stitch without a rolled edge.  Plus the brim is wide enough to cover your ears and keep them warm.  It uses an Elizabeth Zimmermann technique that helps keep the brim from flaring out, which can happen with folded hems.

**Forth Hat**
Our go-to hat pattern. This classic beanie is easy to knit and endlessly customisable. Simply choose your yarn and cast on, no swatching required.

The Forth Hat joins our popular swatchless hat family, alongside the Porty hat and viral bestseller Musselburgh. Forth applies the top-down, swatchless construction to the classic beanie hat. It's the perfect canvas to make your own: simple changes make it a cute bobble hat or classic fisherman's watchcap. The four point crown shaping uses lifted increases for a polished finish that works beautifully with stripes.

Whether you’re an adventurous beginner eager to learn new skills, or an experienced knitter looking for a quick, compelling project you’ll love knitting the Forth Hat. The swatchless design begins at the centre top: the crown is shaped by increasing outward in 4 ‘compass point’ lines. When you’ve created enough fabric to do so you can simply measure your gauge on the project, and match it to the numbers given for your size and gauge. Once the fun crown shaping is complete, there’s lots of soothing stockinette that makes for the perfect “take anywhere” project. Choose from a deep folded brim, or a simple ribbed band – directions are included for both 1x1 and 2x2 rib. 

**Yarn**
Fingering to bulky weight yarn. 

Exact yardage will depend on size, gauge and yarn used. 100–120g of yarn is enough for any size, gauge and yarn combination. For DK-chunky weights you may need extra yarn to add a pom pom to the adult large size.

**DETAILS**
After knitting the Stria Cardigan, I just haven’t been able to get enough of Half-Fishermen’s Rib and stripes! I decided the best use of the leftover yarn would be a cozy hat! The squishy, elastic nature of this stitch pattern means it has great stretch, and each size can fit a variety of noggins. This hat is worked from the brim to the crown, and thanks to the gauge difference between regular ribbing and Half-Fishermen’s Rib, you only need one needle size!

**Worthy of Note**
The June hat is worked in the round from the bottom up. Columns of slipped knit stitches repeat at regular intervals around the hat, breaking up the horizontally striped purl rows. 

There is enough yarn in two skeins of Germantown to make a second hat in the opposite colorway. Use leftovers from the previous months' hats to make the multi-colored pompoms for a pop of color.

1181998,Norway Pine Hat,Sarah Rody,3.69,24.0,4.0,Moss stitch,225.0,"I designed this hat to use some beautiful hand-dyed yarn made by the yarn store in my parents’ hometown of Ely, Minnesota. The cable pattern in the hat comes from Cailyn Meyer’s Logi scarf: [https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/logi-2][1]. Her pattern, and mine, are shared freely under the Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License. 

Norway pine trees, more commonly known as red pine trees, are abundant in Ely. I choose the name Norway Pine for the hat to acknowledge Ely and the source of the yarn as well as the Norse myth that Cailyn used to name the Logi pattern. 

Materials
Yarn: about 200-225 yds (185-205 m) of worsted weight yarn. I used Sisu Hand Dye Worsted from Sisu Designs: [https://sisudesigns.org/][2]. This is a lighter worsted weight (218 yds/200 m per 100 g). Malabrigo Rios or Knit Picks Wool of the Andes would be a good substitute, or pretty much any worsted weight yarn. If you are worried about running out of yarn, you can opt for a single brim. 

Needles: Size US 7 (4.5 mm) needles, or whatever size is needed to make gauge, 16-inch circulars, and double pointed needles (or your preferred method of medium and small circumference knitting in the round). 

Size US 5 (3.75 mm) needles, or 1-2 sizes smaller than your main needles, 16-inch circulars for knitting the brim ribbing. 

Gauge
About 24 stitches and 32 rows in 4 inches by 4 inches (10cm by 10cm) of moss stitch, using the larger needles. I used US 6 needles, but I usually have to use smaller needles, so I’m guessing that US 7 will work for most people. 

Sizing
This hat fits my 22-inch (56 cm) head quite nicely. Due to the stretch of the cables and moss stitch, I think it would fit about 20-24 inches (51-61 cm).To adjust the size, you could change the gauge, change the length the ribbing, or add or subtract multiples of 4 stitches from the moss stitch panels. 

Some knitters are finding this hat a little large. The last picture is a variation on the Version 2 chart that has a cast on of 96 st instead of 112 for snugger ribbing and also takes 8 rounds off of the top in case your hat is getting too long. 

Two Versions
There are two versions of the hat/chart. Version 1 (shown in green) has more moss stitch and 3 cable panels. Version 2 (shown in orange) has less moss stitch and 4 cable panels. The fit is similar.

274353,Anemone Hats,Cat Bordhi,3.19,17.0,4.0,stockinette,300.0,"**If you wear an Anemone Hat, you will have to get used to being stopped by strangers who are smiling at you and want to tell you how much they like your hat.** In the Pacific Northwest, I wear my hats fall through spring, and they inspire ten times as many comments as anything else I have ever designed.  An Anemone Hat can provide all these things for you: cozy warmth, beauty, a non-prescription anti-depressant, and a good-hair day. 

**The pattern includes the Everyday Anemone as well as a heavier version called the Arctic Anemone**, which also has a picot edge variation. 

**Both versions give you the choice of Moebius brim or a simple circle brim.** If you've never made a Moebius before, you'll find detailed instructions, illustrations, and *a live link to my Moebius video tutorial (which has well over a quarter of a million views)* to start you on your way. The pattern also includes a live link to my tendril video tutorial. Designer Annie Modesitt taught me to make tendrils — thank you, Annie! 

**The Everyday Anemone Hat is knit with worsted yarn at 4 1/4 sts to the inch, and comes in five sizes, from baby to large adult. The Arctic Anemone comes in two adult sizes, and is knit with bulky yarn at 3 sts to the inch.** *Both hats should be knit with super wash yarn so the tendrils can be plumped up in the washer and dryer. You will love the transformation when they come out.*

**After years of being asked for the pattern, I am very glad to have finally produced it**  One reason it took so long is that I wanted to rewrite and re-illustrate the Moebius instructions that appeared in my two Moebius knitting books, *A Treasury of Magical Knitting* and *A Second Treasury Of Magical Knitting*, both now out of print. In the years I have been teaching Moebius knitting, I have fine-tuned my instruction it so it is easier to understand, and this pattern reflects that evolution. I do expect to release the two *Treasuries* as eBooks in 2012, with updated material and some new designs as well.

YARN
For everyday Anemone, Lorna’s Laces Shepherd Worsted (100% superwash wool, 100 g / 225 yds), 1 skein. Please use a superwash wool, because machine washing and drying make the tendrils become delightfully bouncy, plump, and elegant.

The Sacred Sheep Hat was designed for the wonderful event of the same name hosted by Ritual Dyes in Portland- the pattern is now available for everyone! 


*The Sacred Sheep Hat is an uncomplicated and enjoyable knit that can be modified to fit different sizes and styles, ranging from toddler to adult large- from skull cap to slouchy beanie. The pattern is remarkably versatile, allowing the use of fingering, DK, or worsted-weight yarn, with the option of incorporating 2 or more colors. This flexibility offers a vast array of possibilities for customization. You can choose between a simple short brim, single-fold or a long, double-fold brim for maximum coziness. You can also pick from 3 different crown heights to make this pattern truly customizable for all sizes and fit preferences!*

**Needles:**
Note that needle sizes are suggested only. You may need to use a different size to achieve gauge. 
Fingering (DK, Worsted)
—One 16” circular needle, US size 2 (4, 6) [2.75, 3.5, 4.0 mm] (or 1-2 sizes smaller than needle required to get gauge)

—US size 3 (6, 8) [3.25, 4.0, 5.0 mm] DPNs or a longer circular needle for Magic Loop method for crown shaping 

**Notions:** 
Stitch marker, scrap yarn or stitch holders, tapestry needle, row counter (optional)

**Gauge:
Fingering (DK, Worsted)**
30 (24, 20) sts and 34 (30, 22) rounds = 4"" [10 cm] in colorwork and stockinette on main needles after blocking

Note- You should always knit your swatch the same way that the pattern is knit—in this case, in the round. Block your swatch as you will your finished garment and allow it to dry fully before measuring.

**Yardage:**  Because of the number of variations possible with this hat, providing yardage isn't feasible. 130 yards of each color will be sufficient for any size if making the worsted weight. If making DK, I would recommend 150 yards of each color. For fingering weight, 200 yards of each color will be plenty! Remember, this pattern is designed to be a great stash buster!

**Sizes** 
Hat is designed to be worn with 1-2"" [2.5-5 cm] of negative ease. Measurements are given for finished (unstretched) circumference. Depth will depend on the brim type and crown height you choose, as described later in the pattern.

1276893,Bewind Hat,Lynnell Koser,2.35,20.0,4.0,,200.0,"The Bewind Hat uses a simple twisted stitch pattern to create a lovely winding motif that spirals its way up to the top of the crown. If you can work a knit 2 together (k2tog), then you can knit the twisted stitch. Beginner friendly!

Choose one skein of your favorite worsted weight yarn and you’ll have a new favorite winter hat in no time!

**NOTE:**
In order to get the swirl, you have to start with an **odd** number of stitches.

When you finish the first round, you are going to have 1 stitch left before the marker. You will **IGNORE** the marker from here on out!

Instead keep working the twisted stitch repeat, until you are ready to begin the crown decreases. When you get to the crown, THIS is when you will need to use that beginning of round marker.

If you feel like the marker is going to be a mental block, (it can also be a pain when you have to twist where the marker is), then omit the marker and simply try to start the crown section as close to the beg of round as you can.

+[media title][2]

**Pattern details**
The pattern includes step-by-step tutorials for key skills, such as: 

* Decreasing
* Finishing the crown of a hat
* Seaming with mattress stitch and whip stitch
* Wrap and turn

The Leith hat is worked from the bottom up, and the pattern includes directions for knitting flat on two needles or in the round. Follow the directions that fit your skill level or preference. 

The triple brim is created by working the first half of the hat in reverse stockinette. At the end this section is folded back on itself, towards the outside of the hat and the cast on edge is sewn to the top of the brim. The join is hidden when the brim is folded up and the hat is worn. The in-the-round version uses a simple trick to work reverse stockinette – without any purling. 

The gathered crown is shaped with three simple decrease rows, which don’t require counting higher than 2, or placing extra markers. It’s the perfect introduction to shaping a project.

Boneyard Sweethearts is knit seamlessly in the round from the bottom up. This is a stranded colorwork design. This pattern is charted. It includes a chart for skeletons with ghosts OR skeletons with hearts. Pick your poison.

I see other knitters asking if their hat is the right size, if it is tall enough, and what age child it will fit. One Trick Pony makes knitting hats easy so you can have fun and eliminate the worry. 

***And what is the one trick you ask?*** All sizes start with a cast on of 60 stitches. Get out your stash — especially single skeins or leftovers. Pick a yarn (or a combination of yarns) and the appropriate size needles using the chart in the pattern. For the body of the hat, you can add textures, stripes, slip stitch and fair isle patterns to make each hat unique. Cast on, knit, and enjoy!

**Pattern #25 in the U.S. National
Park inspired line of beanies**
by Nancy Bates

A visit to the cliff dwellings carved high into the protected sandstone alcoves of these canyon walls in Colorado is like stepping back in time.  The Ancestral Pueblo people who occupied these cliffside communities for generations left behind pottery, tools, and 
other evidence of skilled workers of every kind. This fun-to-knit 
hat gets its inspiration not from the cliff dwellings themselves, but 
from the elaborately decorated black-on-white pottery left behind by the people who lived there.

Fortunately, we know many talented designers, so for the second half of our Year of Hats series we’ve invited a few of our friends to share the hat love!

Meet the August Hat, a lovely, Latvian-inspired beauty by Sarah Solomon. This is the first stranded color work hat of the series, but she kept it simple, interesting, and fun using 2 colors of Germantown, a sweet motif, and Latvian braids. 

**Worthy of Note**
The August Hat is worked in the round from the bottom up. The pattern begins with a brim featuring a two-Color Latvian Braid and botanical–inspired colorwork section. The crown is worked in a diminishing leaf pattern.

The Body Chart and Crown Chart are charted using the MC and CC as shown. This pattern also includes a set of charts using a symbol in place of the MC. If your colors differ, you may elect to color in the symbol chart based on the colors you are using.

**Bothy Hat**
If you are looking for a gift for the adventurous souls in your life, you can call off the search with the Bothy Hat. The ideal headgear for braving the outdoors, it features neat cable decreases that lend the finished knit its classic look – learn this beautifully polished method of shaping ribbing. Meanwhile, the folded brim will keep their ears warm and adds a touch of laid back flair to the design.

This is a project that is perfect for a knitter at any stage of experience. Available in four sizes from toddler to extra large adult and knit from the bottom up. Use double knitting weight yarn to create a tight gauge and guarantee simultaneous wind-proofing and cosiness. The adult sizes feature classic shaping in 4 ‘compass point’ lines. On the smaller sizes decreases are worked in three pairs to allow for enough cable decrease rounds to really show the detail. 

Bothies are found all over Scotland and are often used as refuges for walkers and mountaineers. Many are free of charge to stay in and provide a safe space from the elements, where any traveller can stop for the night, fostering an exchange of stories and information about the paths ahead. Ysolda created the Bothy Hat, inspired by the way these dwellings have become places of reciprocity and connection. And of course, for those who enjoy a hike in any conditions, a windproof hat is essential wear!

**Pattern #16 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

The image of a giant saguaro cactus silhouetted against a desert sunset is synonymous with the American west…and rightly so.   These giant plants with arms that seem to be reaching for the sky are pictured in nearly every TV show or movie about the old west.  This beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) captures that spirit with dark saguaro shapes against a gradient yarn dyed in the colors of the desert sky.

Note:  The sunset colors are achieved with the use of a gradient yarn.

The design can also be made in ""daytime"" colors with green cactus shapes and a blue daytime sky.

**Rhett** by Meghan Babin is a classic cabled beanie made for gatherings around fall campfires, weekend hikes, blustery days, and is a go-to hat that will surely be stuffed into coat pockets from fall through the winter. Made with a deep, squishy fold-over brim, the cables flow naturally from the brim ribbing and decrease away seamlessly into the crown.

Tsov is the Armenian word for sea- and this hat is my take on a classic cabled fisherman's hat for my ocean-loving husband who is of Armenian descent. This hat features a high, folded brim which you can fold to your preference. The deep ribbing and elastic cast on also means hat fits most adult heads. 2 lengths are included, for a taller, slouchy fit (as pictured) or a closer fit.

I used ultra soft worsted weight Ovis Merino Får from [Woolfolk][1] for this hat, perfect for those who are very sensitive to wool's itchiness.

This hat is a skull cap knit in the round in 3x2 ribbing.  One size ideally fits a 23.5"" head circumference; however, this pattern is made in super stretchy ribbing, so the hat can fit slightly wider or smaller heads as well (or you could cast on more or less stitches in multiples of 10 and still follow the pattern as written). Also, this hat was designed to cover just the tops of ears. If you want a hat that fully covers the ears, knit an extra inch (in ribbed pattern) before starting the decreases.

The yardage is given as 2 full skeins; however, the hat actually takes over 1 skein but less than 2 of the Mission Falls wool, but remember: you might need more or less if you use a different yarn or get a different gauge.

**Errata**:  Row 5 of the decreases should read:  Row 5: ^K3, P**1**, P2tog; repeat from ^ until end of row (50 sts remain). The pattern has been fixed as of 2007-10-27.  (Thanks, archaeoknits!)",,8668,4167,4.51,"Ideally fits a head circumference of 23.5"" or 59 cm",Aran

**Crown-shy beanie**
With a folded stockinette brim and engaging cable and dip-stitch pattern, Crown-Shy is the perfect beanie for your next adventure! 

The Crown-Shy Beanie is a must-have for nature lovers who can’t help but pause to look up all around them. Its intricate braided cables and dip-stitch leaves create a stunning three-dimensional texture, while the multi-layered brim ensures warmth and functionality.

The beanie uses heavy DK or worsted weight yarn. You’ll work from the bottom up, beginning with a provisional cast-on. The folded brim is knit together, followed by a hidden section of ribbing that will keep the hat nice and snug. Shaping is worked into the stitch patterns, bringing them together to form a star at the top of the crown. The pattern includes sizes for the whole family, and the folded brim can easily be substituted for a simple rib to give a different style.

*Nothing says winter to a northerner quite like fresh snowfall and a hot drink in hand. The light, fluffy flakes can make the whole world feel like a snow globe, and the picturesque landscape of Alaska's mountains and rivers certainly don't detract from that vision. This hat is inspired by the spicy scents at Alaska's own Kobuk Coffee Co., where cinnamon, clove, and orange from their signature tea mingle with the stronger richness of freshly ground coffee. Similar, perhaps, to how the speckles in Madelinetosh's Modern Fair Isle mingle with fluffy laceweight mohair to journey along the knits and purls to create their own rich and textured landscape. Grab a hot tea and pop this cozy hat on your head to keep warm, and go walking in your own winter wonderland!*

**Materials:
Yarn:**
Kobuk is knit holding 2 yarns together- one DK weight merino wool and one lace weight mohair to create a super-soft, warm fabric with a lovely halo. As Q Mohair can be hard to find, I suggest Rowan Kidsilk Haze as an alternative. It can also be knit in worsted weight, as was successfully done by some of the testers.

**Sample uses:**
Madelinetosh Tosh DK in Modern Fair Isle (100% superwash merino 100g/225 yds)

30% Silk 50g/459 yds)

I was playing with them one day and thought that knitting a hat with two strands, slowly changing colors, would be a fun way to use some of them up.

Yummy 2-Ply held double makes such a wonderfully squishy fabric that I was instantly hooked, and have already knit 6 of these hats!

**DESCRIPTION**
The Essential Beanie is a classic fitted rib beanie with instructions included for six different yarn weights. My intention for this design was to make my ideal everyday hat with simple, thoughtful details. Instructions are included for a single fold or double fold brim, to suit your personal preference. The resulting beanie is so wearable, you might want to make one in all your favorite colors just as I did!

This pattern’s straightforward instructions and low yardage requirements make it a great beginner project and a perfect on-the-go knit. This hat is particularly suitable for using that special skein you’ve been seeking the right project for, or for trying out a yarn you’ve had your eye on. And of course, hats are always great candidates for gift knits that recipients are sure to love.

**SIZING**
This pattern is graded to 4 sizes, (Child, Adult S, Adult L, Adult XL), designed to fit head circumferences of (19, 21, 23, 25)” / (47.5, 52.5, 57.5, 62.5) cm.

This hat is intended to be worn with approximately 6” / 15 cm of negative ease. This amount of ease creates a nice and snugly fitted hat. If you prefer a looser fit you may choose to size up.

**SAMPLES**

7287703,Solvation Hat,Amanda Stephens,3.88,29.0,4.0,Cable Panel Repeat,400.0,"DESIGN INSPIRATION

In Chemistry, when solvent molecules interact closely with molecules of solute, the interaction is called “solvation.” For example, when you dissolve table salt in water, the water molecules surround the sodium ions and chloride ions, separating the two and allowing for a solution to form. When I was designing the Solvation Hat, I wanted to surround the braided cables with garter stitch so that the cables would pop against the background, but much like the positively charged sodium ion needs to be balanced by the negatively charged chloride ion in solution, I added the rib columns to balance out the cables.

CONSTRUCTION

The Solvation Hat is knit from the bottom to the top, beginning with a German Twisted Cast-On and 1x1 rib. A double lateral braid transitions nicely from the brim to the body of the hat, where braided cables and a faux rib texture highlight your yarn choice. Carefully placed increases keep the cables from bunching the brim, and the cables and texture are continued into the crown decreases. With plenty of rest rounds and an easy-to-memorize pattern repeat, this hat will fly off of your needles.

Originally appearing in the Holiday Gifts 2007 issue of Interweave Knits magazine, this pattern was inspired by the work of Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, whose geometric, structural design of the Seattle Central Library is mirrored in the cabled lattice motif. Slanting twisted stitches cross and recross, transforming architectural planes into organic curves that gently hug the head to gather in a striking starburst crown.

I've never been any good at knowing when to stop. And I used to feel sort of bad about it—to think that, if only I could be a bit more moderate, a bit less enthusiastic, things might be easier.

But these days? These days I just embrace it. When I like something, I really really really like it. And that's ok. Actually, it's kind of fun!

So given how I feel about the first of these patterns, it should surprise absolutely no one that I wasn't ready to be done after just one hat. Not even after one hat worked two different ways. Because wow does working this with a contrast color do something sort of magical. I should have known there there would need to be [mitts][1] (also worked two different ways because once you know, how could you not). Oh and just possibly a [bonus version][2] of the hat just for super secret friends, because sure why not (you can see it in one of the pictures towards the bottom).

This is just how I'm wired. And I'm totally going to bring you all along for the ride. Though whether that's a promise or a threat is up to you!

<hr>

**General information**

This 28-page ebook includes the patterns for both the Constellate hat and the matching mitts and includes information for both the solid color version and the contrast color version of both patterns. (The patterns are only available together as a set, they are not available individually.)


**Skills & scope**

The actual knitting is surprisingly simple. These are, at their heart, just basic ribbed hat and mitts. And every now and then, you'll reach down through your fabric and pull an extra little loop of yarn through to make things fancy. It's not hard, and there are nifty illustrations to walk you through it step by step.

The pattern uses [charts][3], so you will need to know how to follow a knitting chart.


**Yarn gauge & sizing**

The hat comes in five sizes (from a 104 stitch cast on to a 136 stitch cast on) and is written for four gauges (from five and a half to seven stitches per inch in half stitch increments). The mitts come in four sizes (from a 36 stitch cast on to a 48 stitch cast on) and are are written for five gauges (from five to seven stitches per inch in half stitch increments).

That means you can use just about any weight of yarn from fingering up through worsted, and there will be a size to fit pretty much anyone's head or wrist. Basically anything that will give you a fabric with a drape you like somewhere in that range of gauges will work.

The hats in the pictures took about 375 yards of fingering-weight yarn. The mitts took about 250 yards of fingering-weight yarn. The fancy stitches do take a bit of extra yarn, as does the folded brim on the hat, so you will likely need a bit more yarn than you're used to. But 400 yards should be a safe bet for any size hat and 300 yards for any size mitt.

**Tools & supplies**

You’ll need needles that let you work in the round (circulars or DPNs) in whatever size lets you get a solid fabric with your chosen yarn plus the general knitting tools you need for most projects (scissors to cut your yarn, a darning needle to weave in ends, the occasional stitch marker, a bit of scrap yarn to hold some stitches).

<hr>

**Note**

The hat was initially available as a stand alone pattern. But I wanted to make sure anyone who has the hat and wants the mitts doesn’t have to buy the hat a second time, so I set up a code that will let folks who already bought Constellate deduct the full price of the hat pattern from the price of the set.

**To find the code, make sure you’ve got the most recent version of the Constellate pattern (an update went out on October 16, 2023 that's the one you're looking for), then look for the last paragraph of the Pattern Notes section on page two.** You’ll find the code there! It should work right now and will be active as long as the patterns are listed on ravelry.

This yarn is beautifully wound for excellent stitch definition, and the array of tonal solids available perfectly highlight the lovely textured cables of the hat.

by Nancy Bates

At 14,400 feet, the peak of majestic Mount Rainier is covered with snow year-round, even in the midst of summer when thousands of colorful wildflowers bloom in the meadows below.  This beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) captures this beautiful scene in a fun-to-knit fair isle pattern using 7 different colors.

Although this hat calls for seven colors, you will not use more than approx. 50 yards of any one color, and only about 10 yards each of the colors used for the flowers.

By Gudrun Johnston

**This pattern has been updated (April 9th 2020) to include instructions for a beret option.**

I am always impressed by the myriad shades of colour that can be seen in Shetland, the blues of the sea, the mossy greens and browns of the hillside and the bright pops of wildflowers and heather in the summer. I never tire of walking in this landscape and soaking in the rich palette. I also love to wear a slouchy style hat that can be pulled down to cover my ears when it’s cold and windy outside! All of these elements played a part in this design. The Bousta Beanie uses three colours combined to great effect within a simple Fair Isle pattern. What with all the colours available in Shetland yarn the possibilities are endless!

**Pattern #1 in the original U.S. National Park Inspired 
line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

Inspired by the beautiful Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, this colorful beanie is worked in the round from the bottom up. The carefully chosen shades represent the spectacular colors of the spring from the grey/white earth of its surroundings to the deep blue in the center, while the fair isle motif itself is a nod to the cold Wyoming winters. An optional wispy white pom pom represents the steam rising from the hot spring. Whether you choose the traditional colors of the magnificent spring itself or another combination of favorite colors, this fair isle pattern knits up fairly quickly and is easy enough for beginners. 

Pattern calls for 5 skeins of yarn, but you will not use the entire skein of any color.

The Rhode Trip Hat (formerly Hat No. 5) is the fifth hat I designed in 2012 while knitting hats for a great project run by  a local yarn store (Lovelyarns), called the 500 Hats Project.  This hat has become a staple and I love knitting it as gifts and I have made at least four for myself. The pattern deserved an update and a better name than hat no. 5!

This hat is knit in the round and uses basic cabling. This is a great project for an adventurous beginner ready to take on a cabled hat or an experienced knitter looking for an easy to remember, quick cabled hat pattern. There is a companion cowl, the Rhode Trip Cowl, also available as a free download on Ravelry.

Need a quick and easy hat for your fella?

Have no fear.

Here's why this hat pattern is so awesome.

1. It's easyyyyy to make and the pattern is a breeze to memorize.
2. It's a basic hat so even the pickiest of guys will want to wear it.
3. It's fast. Took me 5 hours to knit so you could whip this out last minute if you needed to.
4. It's fun to change up! Do stripes if you like or make a bunch of them in every color.
5. It's unisex... yep. Gals can wear it too, of course, so make one for all the gals you love.
6. It's stretchy so fit isn't crucial as it'll fit virtually all adult heads. Yay.
7. It has a brim. So again, you don't have to stress about it being the perfect height. It can always be rolled up to suit the wearer.
8. You'll be sure to get lots of responses like: ""You MADE this? Wow! It looks so professional and store-bought!""  Thank you. We knitters choose to take that as a compliment.

YARN: One skein of 100 g or 115 g (3.5 - 4 oz) DK or Worsted Weight yarn. I used one skein of my Dewy DK yarn in colorway GRAY PEARL. If you don't see it on my site, it's sold out. My shades sell fast and we list new ones frequently, so just choose any color you like from the DK or Worsted Weight categories.

Make sure the yarn you choose has some STRETCH. Preferably wool or yak or even alpaca would work.

Pure silk might not be the best as it doesn't have any stretch.

NEEDLES: US size 9 (5.5mm) circulars if you prefer magic loop. Or dpns will of course work too. (Double pointed needles)

STORY BEHIND THE PATTERN: Funny thing. I called it the ""Boyfriend Beanie"" because they both start with b's. But that delish fellow in the photos is my husband. And... he was just modeling the hat. I actually made it for my dad. He never requests anything but wanted a basic ribbed, brimmed hat to keep his head and ears warm while he checks on his cows over on the farm so I whipped out my needles and voila. This hat was born. We snapped the pictures and then bundled up the hat and sent it off on its way to my pa.

So there you have it! If you love it, please pin it, tweet it, facebook it, instagram it, ya know. If you want. ;)

We continue to be overwhelmed at the positive reception to our [Year of Hats][1] from 2019, and it was a no brainer to do it again in [Germantown Bulky][2]!

Knit this cute hat during the spring or summer months and the delightful color and fun flowers will brighten your days when winter arrives!

**Worthy of Note**
Upsala is worked in the round from the bottom up. It begins with a twisted knit 1, purl 1 ribbing at the brim, and then a fun dandelion pattern is worked around the body of the hat. Decreases are integrated into the stitch pattern to shape the crown.

Due to the nature of the stitch pattern, you will need to remove and replace the marker indicating the beginning of the round at the end of each twelve round repeat.

The classic watch cap style looks great on just about everybody. The all-over ribbing makes a stretchy fabric, so fitting is easy. And this pattern is great for using up your leftovers from other projects, since a striped hat is always fun!

I offer this pattern to you at no cost, in the hopes that you’ll make many, many gifts. In return, I ask that you make a hat for the charity of your choice. If you don’t have time to knit an extra hat, please consider donating cash equal to what you’d expect to pay for a pattern.

If you don’t have a charity in mind, may I suggest [Knit the Rainbow][1]? [www.knittherainbow.org]
This organization collects warm, handmade winter garments to be distributed to the thousands of homeless LGBTQ+ youth in New York City. These vulnerable, often-overlooked, young people are worthy of our care and protection. Knitting a hat seems the least I can do. Won’t you join me?

**Size**
One size fits most teenagers and adults

**Finished Measurements**
*Head circumference:*
Approximately 16” / 40.5 cm without stretching
*Length:* 11” / 28 cm uncuffed
The 2x2 ribbing in this hat makes a very stretchy fabric. The finished hat will comfortably fit heads ranging from 18-24” / 45.5-61 cm.

**Yarn Requirements**
*Fingering or sock weight:* 240 yards
*DK weight:* 210 yards
*Worsted weight:* 180 yards
This pattern is a great stash-buster. The yardage given above is the total needed for a single hat. Gather up your bits and pieces and partial balls of yarn. As long as the yarn thickness is relatively consistent, you can change color as often as you please for a one-of-a-kind striped hat!

**Needles**
16” / 40 cm circular needle and set of 4 double pointed needles or needles in preferred style for small circumference knitting in the round.
*Fingering or sock weight:* US size 3 (3.25 mm)

Original pattern notes:

After recently knitting [Kelly Herdich's In Threes Baby Cardigan][2] for my soon-to-be-born granddaughter, I wanted to knit a little beanie to match! The quick and easy 1-2-3 Baby Beanie is what I came up with! 

Why 1-2-3? 

This wee beanie can be knit in sizes 0-3, 3-6, or 6-12 months with either 1, 2, or 3 sections of garter stitch striping; it's up to you. :)

I'm really pleased with how it turned out; it's cute, it's easy to knit, and it works up quickly with worsted weight yarn. Of course, you don't have to knit an In Threes Baby Cardi to make one for the special baby in your life; this pattern should match nicely with just about any baby knit that uses garter stitch rows or edging!

This pattern is part of our *[BT by Brooklyn Tweed][4]* pattern line; a collection of skill-accessible knitting patterns written in a concise, visually appealing way. Each pattern offers a beginner-friendly entry point into the larger world of Brooklyn Tweed yarns and patterns. Projects you make from *BT by Brooklyn Tweed* will be straightforward to knit and fun to wear!

----------------------------------------

**Construction**

* This double-layered hat is worked seamlessly from end to end in a single piece. Casting on a small number of stitches, the hat begins with a top-down crown (shaped with increases). Once your full hat circumference has been reached, you will knit circularly to the desired length for your size and style (Beanie or Watchcap), then work a second crown (shaped with decreases) that mirrors the first to achieve a completed hat that resembles an elongated egg. Fold the finished piece in upon itself at the halfway point, punching one crown into the second crown, to create a double-thick, reversible stockinette cap that’s both warm and stylish.

**Finished Dimensions**

Newborn (Baby, Child, Adult, Adult Large)

* Finished Circumference: 12 (15, 17, 18½, 20)” \[30.5 (38, 43, 47, 51) cm]
* To fit head sizes: 11-13 (14-16, 17-19, 20-22, 23-25)” \[28-33 (35.5-40.5, 43-48, 51-56, 58.5-63.5) cm]

**Yarn**

Brooklyn Tweed *Tones Light* — 100% Columbia Wool (225 yards/206 meters per 50g skein)

* Newborn (Baby, Child, Adult, Adult Large)
* Beanie: 1 (1, 2, 2, 2)
* Watchcap: 1 (2, 2, 2, 2)
* Adult Watchcap photographed in *Vacay Undertone*
* Adult Watchcap striped variation photographed in *Baseline Overtone* & *Stonewash Overtone*
* Child Watchcap two-in-one variation photographed in *Granita Undertone* & *Granita Overtone*
* Adult Beanie two-in-one variation photographed in *Goldfinch Overtone* & *Goldfinch Undertone*

Potential yarn substitutes include *Peerie* yarn. Note that put-ups (yardage per skein) may be different for alternate yarn lines, so check your total yardage for your size.

* Adult Watchcap photographed in Peerie *Alizarin*

**Yardage**

* Beanie uses approximately 115 (184, 256, 302, 357) total yards \[105 (168, 234, 276, 326) meters] of fingering weight yarn
* Watchcap uses approximately 142 (236, 332, 382, 434) total yards \[130 (216, 304, 349, 397) meters] of fingering weight yarn

**Gauge**

* 6 stitches per inch, measured over stockinette stitch after blocking
* 24 stitches & 36 rounds = 4”/10 cm, exact row gauge is not critical
* *Note that finished fabric has stretch. Finished measurements refer to unstretched fabric dimensions; the hat will fit head sizes that measure larger than circumferences listed.*

**Needles**

16”/40 cm circular needle

* Suggested size US 5 (3.75 mm)
* *Note: Not required for newborn & baby sizes*

Double pointed needles (DPNs)

Its clean lines—no visible edging treatment, no cuff, and nearly no visible shaping—are perfect for sublimely soft, squishy yarns that produce dense, delicious fabric. It just feels good.

***It’s designed in four gauges:*** DK, worsted, heavy-worsted and chunky weight; and with two lengths for more or less slouch.

We have knit seven (yes seven!) different versions of this wonderfully versatile hat from one single spectacular pattern!  

***************************************
Our woolly versions in order from top photo to bottom are:

**Manos Serpentina** - Fun and festive in Manos del Uruguay Serpentina. This chunky-weight yarn has a delicate, twisted effect that mimics the paper streamers that fill the air during carnivale. Its charming, hand-dyed, thick-and-thin strand has vibrant colors twirling together throughout!

**Rowan Cocoon** - This version of the Minimalist Hat is knit in Rowan Cocoon, a lofty, soft, chunky-weight fiber. Reminiscent of a roving-style yarn, its blend of merino and mohair gives great stitch definition, a subtle, silky luster, and—in this simple hat—an unbelievable snuggly-ness!

**Sesia Lola** - the Minimalist Hat in Sesia Lola, is a chunky-weight yarn with subtle variegations, a gentle ripple, and a soft sparkle. Lola has a fascinating structure—two larger strands are twisted with two thread-like strands. The difference in tension creates a yarn with a beguiling little wave! Tonal variations and a sequin winking here or there makes for a Minimalist Hat that’s perfect for a night out ice-skating under twinkle lights.

**Lang Yarns Cashmere Light**  - In Lang Cashmere Light, the Minimalist Hat is like a small cloud of featherlight fluff. Worsted-weight and oh, so soft, this yarn has a loose, chainette construction. Precious, softly waving fibers from the downy coats of cashmere goats are blown through, giving Cashmere Light (and this simple hat) plenty of puff.

**Blue Sky Fibers Techno** - We knit our Minimalist Hat in the tech-savvy Blue Sky Fibers Techno. This multi-talented, heavy worsted-weight yarn has a core of silken mesh blown through with delicate, baby alpaca fibers. Weightless and lofty, its soft and airy fuzz promises to keep your head nice and warm!

**Rowan Brushed Fleece** - Plush, chunky-weight Rowan Brushed Fleece yields a wonderfully cozy Minimalist Hat. A super-soft blend of extra fine merino and baby alpaca, Brushed Fleece is warm and insulating but remarkably light. And all that plump fluff means you’ll have a snuggly hat in no time!

**Lang Yarns Luna** - The Minimalist Hat is wonderful in Lang Luna. It’s got oodles of texture, loads of softness, and heaps of squish! This worsted-weight yarn has a chainette construction that captures a generous amount of alpaca fiber in a nylon core. With a strand that’s reminiscent of bouclé, Luna shines in this plush, cuddly hat.

**Woolfolk Flette** - The Minimalist Hat in Flette, is a dynamic textured yarn. Flette, or ‘braid’ in Danish, is a malleable DK-weight yarn created with 100% Ultimate Merino. One lofty strand is ruched, spiral-like, onto a single fine thread for a puffy, plump bouclé effect. It makes even simple stockinette have the texture and squish of a cloud!

**Pattern #19 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

At a depth of 1,943 feet, Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States and one of the purest in the world.  This perfect combination of depth and purity atop an ancient volcano creates a blue so stunning, it almost seems unreal. This fun-to-knit beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) captures the unforgettable scene of forest, crater rim, azure water, and, of course, lovely Wizard Island, the tip of the volcano.

by Nancy Bates

Of the 700+ lakes found within the forests and mountains of Glacier National Park, the colorful stones lining the shore of beautiful Lake McDonald make it one of the most photographed.  This beanie uses subdued colors and smooth stitches to capture the serenity of the scene from colorful pebbles on the shore and in shallow water, to the deeper blue of the lake, mountain reflection, mountains, and sky…resulting in an overall sense of tranquility.

Laxo Worsted is a riff on Laxo Hat from my first (and only!) book Knockout Knits. Knit in the round from the bottom up, Laxo Worsted starts with a folded brim that creates extra warmth for your ears.  The hat body features elongated stitches that flow in and out with a cabling technique that results in a fabric with lots of squish and elasticity. In a bonus move, no cable needle is used in the knitting of this hat! And those crown decreases… don’t you just love how they come together?

Sized for toddlers through large adult, Laxo Worsted is a quick knit and the perfect gift!  Most sizes use less than 250 yds of worsted weight yarn (shown here in Cece’s Wool American Ewe Tweed), it is the perfect pattern for those skeins of worsted weight you have in stash.

Let's hear it for free patterns and free breakfast, when you can get it. This waffle hat is designed to fit everyone in the family. It is sized to fit baby through adult. However, my gauge is pretty loose, so you may need to go up in needle size. Additionally, the pattern details how to add stitches for even larger sizes. This really is a solid hat recipe that can be used over and over.

Smaller yarn weights can be substituted and held together to achieve gauge. This pattern is highly adaptable to fit every knitter's needs...and stash.

I started dreaming up my own spin on this style a while ago but for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to get the math right - it took so many failed attempts to get this pattern just right, and I am so happy with it now. 

I've named this hat after the Gales of November. Each year as winter approaches extreme winds kick up waves on Lake Superior, in some spots sending water churning hundreds of feet up the sides of cliffs along the shore. It's a beautiful, tumultuous sight to see the waves rolling in over and over.

This hat is knit with Super Bulky yarn.

!!! PLEASE chose size correctly! Follow head circumference and not approximate age! - Finished hat will be in sizing as in the pattern, based on the average size chart, which might not match your child's/yours head! Measure circumference first and choose size based on head circumference!!! For circumference on the edge you must follow next size. F.e. if your 6 month old baby has a 17"" head circumference - you must follow toddler 1-3 y.o. size! Do not add any rows or rounds - it makes the hat taller - and floppier - there will be no ""ears"" and only squared top instead. If you finish 3-needle BO on WS - you must add at least 2 rounds - because finishing inside will shorten your hat - keep in mind look of the hat will be different than pictured ! In the pattern BO is made on RS purposely, so the ears are sharp with clean edges! --> BEFORE knit entirely hat - measure your hat at around 2""/5cm of body level (NOT brim) - finished sizes are PROVIDED in the pattern - If your hat is not wide enough as for the size you made - you made it somewhere incorrectly, start all over. Before BO - measure height - if your hat is shorter than in the pattern - only then add rows/rounds and BO... Contact me for an advice before you want make any changes - all reviews about size is too small - are based on incorrect knitting, not checking gauge (Drops yarn is thicker than rest of brands - it is thicker, heavy worsted yarn!), substitution of yarn and mostly - choosing wrong size!!! not fault of the pattern - all sizes and fitting were checked while testing... see image on a baby - this is correct fit - this is NOT slouch design.

* Please note, image on a baby presents correct fit! -
 there are shouldn't be any loose on top, or ears wouldn't looks good! Baby wearing BABY size fox hat is (she is 12 mo with 17"" head circumference during pics - no room to grow! fitted look, your baby may have different head size!).

**Important Note:** to achieve the best result, please use the recommended yarn, a substitute might not give you similar look or size even if you use same needle size! I design my creations for a particular yarn and I am swatching a lot to find the perfect look...

* please note, so the look is as designed and as presented on pics - the top of the hat should meet the top of head! Otherwise there will be ease and ""slouchy"" top (what happened if sized up) - what wasn't in the design! - the ears wouldn't have that stand out look*

  This Pattern is designed for you to be able to knit a fun cute hat in an easy way - no decreasing - knitted in one piece. Beginners could make this hat quite easily. Magic will happen as soon as someone wears it :-)
  
  Originally I designed it to be a kitten, but by a simple change of the color of the yarn to orange, it becomes a fox :-)

  Pattern includes all sizes - from newborn to adult. You can use any worsted yarn suitable for US 8-9 (5-5.5mm) needles. Most of the sizes (depending on the yardage of the yarn) require only one skein and would take just one evening (or morning, if you prefer) to complete.

the sizes are an average measurement for listed sizes:
!!!! check circumference and choose size based on circumference, NOT AGE !!!!

**Some knitters are reporting that this hat runs small. I am a loose knitter. So, please compare your gauge to that in the pattern. If your gauge differs, adjust hat size accordingly.** 

The Backcountry Hat is knit in the round using circular and double pointed needles. The pattern is very simple, perfect for beginning knitters.  It knits up lightning fast and makes a great last minute gift project.  Add stripes, a pom pom or a tassel to jazz it up!

**Yarn:** 
One skein of [Luna Grey Fiber Arts Apollo][1] yarn (100% Superwash Merino Wool, 106 yards/100g). Or other bulky/chunky weight wool yarn.  Samples knit in the Charcoal, Emerald and Araucana colorways.  Pom poms may be added, but will require additional yarn.    
	
**Needles:** 
One US # 7 (4.5 mm) 16” circular needle or two sizes smaller than needle used for body of hat based on gauge.
One US # 9 (5.5 mm) 16” circular needle or size needed to obtain gauge.
One set US # 9 (5.5 mm) double pointed needles or size needed to obtain gauge.
	
For Baby size: As the circumference is quite small, the entire hat can be knit on double pointed needles sizes US # 7 (4.5 mm) for ribbing and US # 9 (5.5 mm) for hat body.

This cabled hat is pure joy to knit and works up quickly in Shelter as either a fitted beanie or a double-brimmed watchcap. Above the ribbed brim, diamond knots filled with double seed stitch link elbows between simple cables that meet at the crown. Either hat is stretchy enough to accommodate most adult heads, so you can knit different colors for your dear ones. Add a jolly pompom for a youthful, slouchy effect.

by Nancy Bates**

If you're ever on a road trip and you spot the characteristic ""hairy"" branches and spiky green tufts of a Joshua Tree, you can only be in one place...the southwestern United States.  These unique trees growing straight out of the desert floor with arms that reach out in every direction have a look that many would call ""whimsical.""  It's the perfect description!  This fun and whimsical beanie (worked from the bottom up) uses a combination of cables and bobbles to create six Joshua Trees growing right out of the ribbing of your hat.

133784,Hermione Hearts Ron,Christy Aylesworth,2.9,26.0,4.0,Stockinette Stitch,,"This sweet little hat was inspired by the movie based on the book *Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.* It's the prefect marriage of substantial cables and and feminine lace – perfect for transitional weather. The top of this hat features unique decreases, resulting in a beautiful snowflake effect when viewed from the top. Even if you're not a Harry Potter fan, this is a hat even the most discerning wearer will love!

**Clarification notes on decreases:** I get many PM's about how to continue decreases as established, and, sadly, I'm not on Ravelry very often. If you have trouble continuing the decreases as established after they're spelled out in the pattern, I hope the notes below will help. Additionally, feel free to PM me, but I'd highly encourage you to seek help at your friendly neighborhood LYS as many (many!) knitting problems are easier solved when both the knitter and helper can look at the piece. 
So, first off: look at the decreases you’ve done so far. (Always a great first step. :) ) You should notice that they’re stacked neatly on top of each other, starting to form that nice snowflake shape as they draw nearer to each other. Secondly, if you look at the instructions for the decreases written in the pattern, you’ll notice that the number of stitches between each decrease reduces by one on each row. That number reduction is what makes the decreases stack so nicely, and is what I mean by “decrease as established”. If you keep working one less stitch between decreases, you’ll be working within the established pattern of one less stitch between decreases. Hope this helps!

***If you take an upside-down picture like I did for the pattern, message me and I'll feature it on my gallery!***

With three different brim styles to choose from, this is a versatile pattern for all ages. 

**Approximate Finished Measurements:** 
To Fit: Newborn (Baby, Toddler, Kid, Adult Small, Adult Large)
Circumference: 10 ¾ (12 ½, 14 ¼, 16, 17 ¾, 19 ½)”
Length: 5 (6, 6 ¾, 7 ½, 8 ¼, 9)”

**Designer Note** about sizing…This hat is intended to be worn with 1-2” of negative ease. If a looser hat is desired, try sizing up. When in doubt about which size to make, make the size you think you should and add perhaps an inch to the length. The recipient can always fold the brim up, watch cap style.
Keep in mind the sizes are a general guide, since heads can vary so much!

**Materials** 
42 (55, 60, 72, 100, 120)—yards (39 (50, 55, 66, 92, 110) meters) of heavy worsted or aran weight yarn for either the 2x2 Ribbed Brim Version or Rolled Brim Version
54 (67, 72, 84, 112, 132)—yards (49 (61, 66, 77, 102, 121) meters) of heavy worsted or aran weight yarn for the Folded Brim Version
*You will need approximately 30 extra yards if you want a pom pom.* 
- For Newborn, Baby and Toddler Size Only US Size 6 (4mm) and 8 (5mm) double pointed needles or use a 40” length or longer circular for magic loop method. (see below for explanation on magic loop)
- For Kid, Adult Small and Adult Large Only US Size 6 (4mm) and 8 (5mm) 9, 16” circular knitting needle and 
US Size 8 (5mm) double pointed needles or use a 40” length or longer circular for magic loop method. (see below for explanation on magic loop)
- 5 stitch markers, with 4 in one color and 1 in another
- tapestry needle

*About magic loop*…This method allows you to work in the round on a very long circular needle (usually 40” or longer). It is easier than it sounds and a good alternative to using double pointed needles. Find out how to do magic loop at your local yarn shop. 
If you don’t have a local yarn shop handy, try this useful video on how to cast on and work using magic loop: https://youtu.be/iUghJCry_mg

**Gauge**
18 sts, 26 rows = 4” (10cm) in stockinette stitch in the round on US Size 8 (5mm) knitting needle after blocking. Adjust needle size if necessary to obtain the correct gauge.

**Designer Note** The hat is worked in the round from the brim to the crown.  
Pattern is written for the smallest size, with larger sizes in parenthesis. If only one number is given, it applies to all sizes.

The first design is the January Hat by our very own Courtney Kelley. The January Hat features integrated ribbing, large diamond cables, and many, many delightful bobbles. A pom pon tops it all off and a cute custom KW tag completes the look.

In conjunction with the release of the designs, we're also offering limited kits that include a custom leather tag, yarn for sewing the tag on (in both contrast and matching colors), and one skein of Germantown in the recommended color. [Find the kit on our site here][1] or ask for it at your favorite LYS!

**Worthy of Note**
The January Hat is worked in the round from the bottom up. Due to the traveling cable, starting with Round 3, the beginning of the round shifts to the right one stitch on odd numbered round for the first 12 rounds. The beginning of the round then shifts back on odd numbered Rounds 15–25, then back again for the top decreases. The shift is written into the pattern and the marker should always fall before the ‘k2’ of the first diamond cable motif.

**Pattern #15 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

Acadia National Park is known for its beautiful rocky coastlines, spectacular sunrises, quaint carriage roads and stone bridges, and towering granite peaks.  But it also boasts miles and miles of trails through gorgeous woodlands and meadows, including this lovely birch-lined section of Jesup Path, near Jordan Pond.  So often, it’s the sweeping. epic views in the parks that capture our hearts.  But sometimes…it’s the lesser known pockets of solitude and beauty that seep in and hold on.  This beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) uses stranded colorwork to recreate the high contrast look of birch bark, with an optional two-toned pom-pom to represent the leaves.

1217331,Spinnaker Beanie,Emily Sheehan,2.37,,4.0,Pattern,155.0,"The Spinnaker Beanie is a sister pattern to my Spindrift Beanie and Cowl and Seaspray Beanie patterns. Faux cables created by right twisted stitches give the look of little waves. The town of White Bear Lake, MN where I live is known for sailing races, so the Spinnaker Beanie name is a nod to the iconic sailboats on White Bear Lake.

This pattern is written for 4 weights of yarn (worsted, light bulky, bulky, and super bulky), be sure to pick the correct instructions for the yarn weight you're using. A handy resource for yarn substitutions is yarnsub.com. 

The Spinnaker Beanie is knit in the round, from the bottom up. First you will knit the brim in a simple rib stitch which will be later folded up to form an extra cozy, adjustable brim. The body is knit in a four-round repeat, then the crown is shaped with simple decreases.

I designed this pattern for a special baby girl named Kaiya Mei. This Fair Isle motif is intended to fade gradually and randomly from the first color to the second. I chose a multi-color yarn with a natural main color to soften the look, but I think two solid and contrasting colors would work great, too. Get creative!

This pattern includes a chart. However, given the random nature of the motif it is a forgiving pattern, so color mistakes are no biggie!

Kaiya Mei has just received an update with a major face lift! The pattern and chart now accommodates the following sizes:

If you agree, purchase both Oban AND Glenfidditch together and you'll get $3.00 off your total purchase. Code GIFTHATS. This code does NOT expire, because knitting hats as gifts is always fun.**

This one was knit on a whim - in a single day last week. I swatched this cable for something else, got hooked, had been eyeing the Confection Worsted for some time, and boom - before I knew it, I'd cast on and was on my way.  

Because that happens. 

Basic cables and a lovely garter texture create a gorgeous ribbing around the head on Oban. It's classic but just a little different. The garter panels created by the inward facing cables are decreased into the crown in distinct points, as seen around the pom in the pics. The hat is designed to hug the head, and includes a deep brim that can be folded back or worn long for a bit of slouch. 

Notes have been added to the pattern about adjusting for length or width. The hat can easily be made without the pom to feature the crown shaping (and it's a totally unisex without it, IMHO)

Plus, I'm thinking I want to do this again on a sweater in this yarn because it was just so incredibly satisfying. The Corriedale is wonderfully round and springy, and the final fabric is warm and soft and wonderful.... so stay tuned!

Named for the order of birds characterized by perching habits, this fitted hat is worked seamlessly in the round, from ribbing to crown. It features a stranded bird motif in two contrasting colors and a crisp ribbing with a contrasting color accent. 

This pattern is recommended for intermediate-level knitters who have experience with stranded colorwork, reading from charts, and knitting in the round.  

The first hat pictured was created using Tosh Merino Light Unicorn Tails in the Celadon colorway for the main color and a Unicorn Tail in the Dirty Panther colorway for the contrast color. The second hat pictured also uses Tosh Merino Light (Antique Lace for the main color and Fog for the contrast color). 

The finished item measures approximately 20"" in circumference and 9"" from ribbing to the crown.

The pattern is both written and charted in 5 different sizes so that you can make one for everyone in your family! 

The pattern calls for 3 colors of worsted weight (4) yarn and the sample is knit in the beautiful Malabrigo Rios in Hojas (green), Cerveza (red), and Natural (white). You can always do a 2-color hat by using one color for the brim and the body. The color combinations are endless! You can also choose to do a traditional brim instead of the folded brim shown in the photos. 

The pattern calls for size 6 (4.0 mm) and 8 (5.0 mm) 16"" circular needles or DPNs, but make sure to check gauge before starting! Many knitters find that they need to go up a needle size or two when doing colorwork or their hats will be too tight and not fit.

> **Note On Gauge**: Although gauge is important to aim for there is a lot of flexibility with this particular project and garter stitch is very forgiving. After test knitting it was determined that giving a measurement of one segment was a more helpful guide than trying to attain an exact gauge. The row gauge is what will determine the circumference of the beanie so aiming to be closer to that is ultimately more important than stitch gauge. The stitch gauge will determine the overall length of the beanie. It is possible to add or remove stitches from the cast on to accommodate stitch gauge differences. It will also make a difference what type of yarn you use. To more easily match the gauge and fabric shown here a woolly and lofty yarn, like Shetland wool, is recommended. Smoother yarns will yield a different result in the fabric. 

**Size**
Circumference at brim: 16 ½” / 42cm before wearing (this area is very stretchy so will accommodate a wide range of head circumferences)
Length from brim to crown (without folding brim): 11”/ 28cm
Note: Length as worn will vary depending on how you decide to fold the brim edge. Also see note on gauge below.

**Needles**
US 3 / 3.25mm circular needle, 24” / 60cm length (two are needed for TNBO)
US 4 / 3.5mm circular needle, 24” / 60cm length (one needed for TNBO)
US 5 / 3.75mm circular needle, 24” / 60cm length (for main body of hat)
Always use a needle size that will result in the correct gauge after blocking.
Note: You can really use any length of the above needles as no stitches are joined for working in the round. I have listed a length I think is most comfortable for accommodating the number of stitches being worked at one time.

**Yarn**
230 yds / 210m Fingering weight yarn 
shown in:
Jamieson’s Of Shetland Spindrift (100% Pure Shetland Wool; 105m / 115 yds per 25g ball)
Samples shown use: Stonewash (single color no contrasts), Cocoa (Single color, no contrasts), Oyster (single color with contrast brim color of Eucalyptus), Steel/Salmon/ Eggshell/ Eesit (multi color hat with contrast TNBO in Flame)

**Notions**
1 stitch marker, scrap yarn to hold stitches, 4 split ring markers or scrap yarn (to mark RS of knitting), tapestry needle for weaving in ends.

**Gauge**
27 sts & 44 rows = 4” / 10cm worked flat over Garter Stitch on largest needles
One segment of beanie measures approx 3 ¾” / 9.5cm in width and 11” / 28cm in length (not blocked)

**Construction**
This hat is worked flat in garter stitch in 4 separate segments. The pieces are then joined using Three Needle Bind Offs with the seam exposed as worn. Short rows are used to shape what will be the crown of the hat. When worn the garter stitch ridges will sit vertically. Additional length can be added by casting on more stitches. This will of course result in more yarn being needed. You can even play around with color and knit each segment in a different shade, do your three needle bind offs in a contrasting color or pick up stitches from the brim edge and bind off in a different color! There are lots of ways to make it unique!

1. Provide the people of the Women’s March on Washington D.C. a means to make a unique collective visual statement which will help activists be better heard.
2. Provide people who cannot physically be on the National Mall a way to represent them- selves and support women’s rights.

**The more we are seen, the more we are heard.
Let’s come together to support women’s rights in a creative and impactful way.**

If you are a knitter who wants to participate in the Women’s March on Washington D.C., but perhaps cannot attend yourself, please consider making a PINK HAT for a person who will be there. The weather in D.C. that day will be a high of 35-45°F and a low of 15-25°F, so hats will be practically important to keep warm.

1168899,Spooky Hat,RosiePosieKnitCo,2.64,22.0,4.0,stockinette,172.0,"Spooky Hat was inspired by the Halloween season coming up and named by my 5-year old daughter. With four different sizes --baby (toddler, youth/adult small, and adult large) this hat is sure to bring a smile to all the people in your life! Sizes are approximate and hats should be stretchy enough to fit a range of heads! The largest adult size fits with a slouchier fit on an adult head. If you want a tighter fitting hat for an adult, you may want to choose the Youth/Adult Small size. 

The pattern is in both written and charted form and never uses more than 2 colors at once per row. 

I used a hodge-podge of yarn I had on hand in my stash, predominantly Kraemer Perfection Worsted and Malabrigo Rios. Both of these yarns have an excellent range of colors to choose from, but any medium weight yarn will work as long as you check your gauge. This hat is a perfect stash-buster!  Yardage for yarn is approximate and does not include the yarn needed for your pom pom. On my Youth and Adult hats, I used a Large size Clover pom pom maker and used about 28 yards of my contrast color yarn per pom pom. 

I hope you enjoy this pattern and make lots of SpoOooOky Hats for those you love this fall!

Yarn required 1 (1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5) oz of worsted weight yarn.

A note about sizing: Kids' heads are a lot bigger than most adults expect, especially in how long you need to make it before starting the decreases at the crown. Case in point: my 4.5 yr old, 6.5 yr old, and I all wear the youth size! Your family may vary, but I'd suggest you make the larger side when in doubt. The hat is designed to be stretchy and should help with fit. 

I would recommend the child hat for a 2-4 yr old and a youth (which is also the adult small) for 5-preteen. We all like our hats to come down to our earlobes, so the hat is designed with that in mind.

**Pattern #42 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**
by Nancy Bates

65 million years of incredible geologic forces and the power of erosion have sculpted a landscape in Utah that seems impossible.  Over 2000 stone arches spanning distances up to 300 feet stand among pillars, fins, pinnacles, and balancing rocks.  The contrast of bright green trees and shrubs against red orange rock and blue skies have entranced hikers and campers for generations, bringing a feeling of awe and wonder not easily forgotten.  

Featuring a color as warm as the sunsets that grace the landscape, this beanie uses cable stitches to create a double arch embossed against a subtly textured backdrop of rows of knits and purls.  Blue sky peeks through arches in the distance.

It was designed with an adventurer’s spirit, and with this free pattern I hope to pass this spirit along to other knitters.

The body of this hat is knit in a simple broken rib stitch, and it features a favorite method of mine – the folded brim. Using a Provisional CO, sts from the CO edge are later picked up to create a permanently folded brim that is both flexible and extra-toasty.

by Nancy Bates

One of the most iconic images of Katmai National Park is that of Alaskan brown bears catching sockeye salmon along Brooks River every July and September. Fattening up for winter hibernation is an essential part of the lifecycle of bears…and a spectacular tourist attraction for park visitors (from a safe distance, of course).  With more than 2200 bears in the park, Katmai is one of the best bear-viewing locations in the world!  In this fun-to-knit hat, five wilderness-inspired colors come together in a classic design with images of bears, salmon, and trees.  So Alaskan!

A start to finish video tutorial is available for this pattern on my YouTube channel:  https://youtu.be/mA3jo2_LPI0

This hat is worked from the bottom, up using two color brioche stitch in the round.  Stylish and symmetrical decreases will shape the crown of the hat. 

This beanie is designed in three sizes:  
Youth (Adult Small, Adult Large)
Height (brim unfolded):  11, (12, 12.5)"" / 28, (30.5, 32) cm
Circumference:  15, (17, 19)"" / 38, (43.25, 48.25) cm
To fit head size:  18-19, (20-21, 22-23)"" / 45.5-49, (51-53.5, 56-58.5) cm

Brioche stitch creates a very lofty and stretchy fabric.  Because of this, you will want to choose a hat size that is 3-4” smaller than your head circumference.  Hat is photographed in Adult Large and worn on a 22”

Size US 6 (4.00 mm) Double Pointed Needles OR long circular needles for Magic Loop Technique
Size US 8 (5.00 mm) circular knitting needles – any length, used only for cast-on
Stitch Markers
Tapestry needle to weave in ends

Note on yarn:  Because brioche stitch creates a stretchy fabric, it is best to choose a non-superwash, wool yarn.  The yarn that I chose for this hat is Originally Lovely Pura, a superfine merino wool.  A non-superwash wool such as this allows the hat to maintain its shape and elasticity, without becoming overly stretched.  

Please note: Yarn weight and yardage requirements are estimates.  Using yarn of different fiber composition, ply, gauge, and any modifications will lead to differences in yarn usage. 

GAUGE: 
15 stitches and 22 rows = 4” in brioche stitch on size 6 needles.

**Pattern #41 in the original U.S. National Park inspired

by Nancy Bates


Of the 229 square miles that make up Zion National Park, most visitors spend their time in the long narrow canyon that makes this park so popular.  The spectacular reds and oranges of the canyon walls, the green of plants and trees that seem to sprout out of cracks and crevices, and the blues of sky and water create an unforgettable and much beloved scene. Whether you’re hiking the famous Narrows, Angels Landing, or Emerald Pools trails or simply picnicking in a quiet spot along the river, the grandeur of the canyon surrounds you in a palette of warmth and beauty.  This design, filled with the texture and color of the park, takes you from a forest of cottonwood trees, up the canyon walls. to the dark “desert varnish” that paints the orange sandstone with dark streaks.  Near the base of the hat, the Virgin River runs throughout…a reminder of the ever-present force still shaping the canyon today.

Knitted with a worsted weight yarn, the Fisher Cable Hat is a relatively quick and easy project.  It is worked from the bottom up and is mellow enough for a beginning knitter.  The cabled ribbing adds a little spice, but is perfect for learning to cable.  Although this nautical-inspired hat was designed for my favorite fisherman, it looks great on fisherwomen too!

You have the option of a contrast color cast-on, and only THREE rows require you to do any stitches beyond knit, purl, decrease, and slip, yet the overall effect packs a real punch!

Visitors from around the world are drawn to Hawai′i for the lush rainforest, varied wildlife, stunning hikes, and a glimpse of two of the world’s most active volcanoes.  Periodic eruptions send rivers of lava to the coast where the ocean boils and steams as the 1200° C (nearly 2200° F) molten lava pours and drips into the sea, forever changing the landscape…until the next time.

 Worked in the round from the bottom up, this beanie uses 4 colors in a fun to knit fair isle “lava-inspired” design.

727538,Science March Ocean Beanie,Joan Rowe,2.2,18.0,4.0,unblocked stockinette,110.0,"I wanted to design a hat for the science march that would be easy for anyone to knit. I think the pussyhat was so successful because it was a pattern that even beginners could easily knit. Oceans are one of my biggest concerns and so my design is for an ocean themed hat, with waves washing up onto a sandy beach. You can decorate it with a sewn-on ocean themed button or brooch. Since this is a beanie designed to highlight science and the challenges it faces, for the march, you may wish to decorate the beanie with what is now more common than shells on our beaches – plastic trash.

This is a great pattern for using up those leftovers. The ocean can be any number of leftover yarns. Just arrange the colors so that they complement each other, then join in a new color when one is used up. Instructions are given for knitting the hat in the round, which is the fastest way to do it, and also for knitting flat and seaming later, for those who are not ready to try knitting in the round.

Instructions are given for sizes 20” (51 cm) and 23” (58 cm) in worsted weight yarn. These correspond to X-small and med-large adult sizes. By using DK weight yarn and a gauge of 20 sts and 26 rows/4” you can use the 20” pattern to make an 18” beanie (child) and the 23” pattern to make a 21” beanie (small). 

This was designed specifically to be an easy knit. The only stitches needed are K, P, Kfb, K2tog, P2tog.

**Sizes:**	
**(S, M, L) to fit head circumference up to:**
(21, 23, 25+)"" / [(53.5, 58.5, 63.5+)cm]

**Finished Circumference:**
(18, 20, 22)"" / [(45.5, 51, 56)cm]

*Choose a size 1-3” / [2.5-7.5cm] smaller than head circumference. If you are between sizes, size down.*

**Suggested Yarn:**  
MC:	
*Ritual Dyes Sprite (3-ply Sport Weight, 60/40 Merino/Corriedale, 325yds/100g).* Sample knit in Jewelweed colorway.

CC: 	
*Spincycle Yarns Dyed in the Wool (Sport Weight, 100% American Superwash Wool, 200yds/50g).* Sample knit in Verba Volant colorway. Due to supply chain issues, new stock of this yarn is not available, though many yarn shops have skeins available. I am also recommending the Cold Comfort colorway as a substitute. 

You can also use any solid color yarn in the same base as your MC for the CC.

**Suggested Needles:**
Ribbing:	US 4 (3.5mm) 16” circular needles 
Main Body:        US 6 (4.0mm) 16” circular needles + preferred small 
circumference needles 

**Gauge:** 
22 sts & 26 rows in 4”x 4”, stranded colorwork in stockinette stitch in the round, blocked. It is particularly important that you block your gauge swatch in the same manner you will block your finished object, since classic gingham pairs two highly contrasting colors. This comes with bleed risk. You will be able to tell from your blocked gauge swatch whether your colors will bleed. If you notice your colors bleeding in your gauge swatch, I recommend steam blocking.
 
**Yardage:**
Yardages listed assume a single brim. For a folded brim, allot an additional 20yd/18m of MC.
	
*MC (darker color):* 	
(125, 150, 175)yd
(114, 137, 160)m

*CC (lighter color):* 	
(80, 90, 100)yd
(73, 82, 91))m

**Materials:** 	
four removable stitch markers, one regular stitch marker, darning needle

**Optional Materials:**  
smooth Sport or DK weight scrap yarn in contrasting color from MC for tubular cast-on only

**Techniques:** 	
two color stranded colorwork, knitting in the round, decreasing, wet or steam blocking

**Construction:**  
hat is knit from the bottom up with decreases at crown

by Nancy Bates

The ferns, mosses, and lichens of the Hoh Rain Forest cover nearly every surface creating a landscape of vibrant greens from the forest floor to the tops of the trees and every rock, branch, or tree trunk along the way.  This fun-to-knit pattern (worked in the round from the bottom up) creates an organic landscape of stitches that seem to meander their way from the ribbing to the top of the beanie.

Multnomah Falls Hat is a cozy and squishy hat with easy braided cables and a deep foldover brim. 

The hat is truly unisex, is offered in three sizes, and can be made in many yarn weights. Size and height of hat are easily adjusted (instructions are included). The size will vary depending on yarn weight and gauge.

Add a pom pom to top it off if you wish… maybe use a contrasting color for the pom pom? It would also look good with the brim done in a contrasting color and that would enable you to use up more stash yarn too… there are so many options!

Instructions are both charted and written. This pattern has been professionally tech-edited and tested.

by Nancy Bates

From the tree-covered U-shaped valley, to the granite cliffs of El Capitan and Half Dome, to the majestic Bridal Veil Falls, this sweeping view of Yosemite Valley is perhaps one of the most iconic and recognizable scenes of all the U.S. National Parks.  Truly awe-inspiring in any season and any lighting.  This beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) uses a simple textured stitch for the trees of the valley floor, while stranded stockinette stitch paints the rest of this remarkable scene.  The optional waterfall in duplicate stitch is the finishing touch.

line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates


With an elevation that spans 7,600 to 14,259 feet, Rocky Mountain features a diversity of ecosystems that make this park a uniquely beautiful and adventurous place to visit.  In this design, simple stranded knitting and 10 carefully chosen colors take you on a journey to four different lakes in two seasons as you gain elevation up the mountains.  Your knitting adventure begins in subalpine meadows with summertime wildflowers before moving on to Bear Lake and quaking aspens as they appear in the Fall.  Continue up to Nymph Lake dotted with lily pads and Dream Lake surrounded by evergreens.  The final stop is lovely Emerald Lake, near the edge of the timberline with snowcapped peaks nearby.   


This pattern continues Nancy Bates’ series of 63 Beanies inspired by the U.S. National Parks. It was first released in the book Knitting the National Parks.

This pattern uses 10 colors of worsted weight yarn:

This hat is a great way to use up those little leftover balls of yarn in your stash. 

I have designed the pattern for preemie and newborn sizes.  Gauge is not critical for this pattern, because the hat is very stretchy and will accommodate a wide range of head sizes. Each hat should use less than 30g of yarn. I like to add a small pompom to the top to make it extra cute.

There are many places that take donations of preemie and baby hats. A good place to start would be checking with your local NICU to see what kind of requirements they have for materials. Some places will only accept washable items, some will take any kind of hat, while some will only take acrylic hats, etc. ",,129,42,4.89,"Preemie, Newborn",Any gauge

**A** **N**ew **T**ake on the double layered reversible beanie in which there are so many versions out there, here is to them all.

This design was inspired by a hat that was seen while window shopping, and I decided to challenge myself to knit my own from scratch. Using the tools and tricks I’ve learned over my years of knitting I have applied them to my “new take” of a reversible beanie. I was inspired by the beautiful colors in the mYak palette and the baby yak lace makes a wonderful fingering weight when held double. With all this in mind this pattern is named **A.N.T**. - A New Take … 

**CONSTRUCTION**
This hat is reversible and can be worn as a slouch hat or the brim folded to wear as a beanie and show off both colors. The hat uses square crown shaping, the “+” shape on the Color A side and pinwheel shaping on the color B side. Using color A, the hat is worked from the brim to the crown starting with a provisional cast on, then using Color B, the live stitches of Color A are picked up and knit to the pinwheel crown. Both crowns are constructed using slip slip knit and knit two together. Because both crowns are knit at the end of each side you can either switch the crowns or if you prefer make both crowns the same. Ends are woven in before beginning the crown of Color B.

**GAUGE**
26 stitches x 36 rows = 4” / 10 cm

**YARN**
2 Skeins mYak baby yak lace 50 gr (380 yds/350 mt)  held double or any fingering weight yarn to achieve gauge.

The Winter Dreamer hat features a unique and striking ribbed cable pattern. Bulky/Chunky weight wool creates plump stitch definition and makes this a quick and satisfying knit.

The special cables create a 4X1 rib that expands once blocked, so it’s highly recommended that you use a natural fiber, instead of acrylic or a high percentage acrylic blend.

*Note: A stretchy cast on is critical for the ribbed brim. This is what makes the hat accommodating to a wider range of head sizes. Practice this technique with the video tutorial. I promise you, it's fun and addictive!*

Take Wing features a decorative brim encircled with pairs of wings.  Peek inside, and you’ll find a cozy ribbed brim lining.  This double-brim construction provides extra warmth while ensuring that the brim edge is soft and stretchy.  The rest of the hat is worked in stockinette stitch, making it easy to customize its height.

Take Wing is worked from the bottom up in worsted-weight yarn.  If you are new to twisted stitches or cables, this hat is a great chance to spread your wings — only the knit stitches are worked through the back loop, all of the cables can be worked without a cable needle, and links to video tutorials are included for any special techniques.  

You’ll love the beautiful textures these techniques create.

This hat was designed in 100% superwash merino indie dyed yarns from The Wandering Flock and Salty Blonde Fiber. However, any wool or wool/blend yarn should work, as long as you achieve gauge. Please note that the pattern features a relatively tight gauge in each of the recommended yarn weights, which makes the fabric denser and gives the hat more structure and warmth when worn.

*The yarns used for the samples in the pattern photos are The Wandering Flock Merino Fingering Singles (colorway Holograph Dreams), Salty Blonde Fibers Worsted Neons (colorway Glowstick), The Wandering Flock Bulky (colorway Peach Pop).*

**Pattern #12 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

A cross section of a petrified tree reveals a beautiful kaleidoscope of unexpected colors: lavender, red, green, yellow, grey and more.  Remarkably, even after millions of years, most logs still maintain the look of bark on the outside.  Absolutely fascinating!

1186963,Holly Jolly Hat,RosiePosieKnitCo,3.15,20.0,4.0,stockinette ,221.0,"The Holly Jolly hat was inspired by all the things I love most at Christmastime! Hot cocoa, Christmas trees, reindeer, decking the halls with garland, and snow. What could be better? 
  
The best part about the Holly Jolly Hat is that you get to have options with the pattern!  
Written and charted in four different sizes –Baby (Toddler, Youth/Adult Small, and Adult Large), you can make one for the whole family. Plus, due to lots of feedback from knitters, there are two different design options. Choose from either reindeer or hot cocoa mugs in each of the four sizes. Simply choose your size and find the corresponding chart for the size and design of your choice.   
  
Sizes are approximate and hats should be stretchy enough to fit a wide range of head sizes. The largest has a bit of slouch on an average adult head, so if you are looking for a tighter, more traditional beanie fit, you may want to size down to the Youth/Adult Small size. Due to the nature of the designs, the reindeer hat, regardless of size, will be a longer hat than the cocoa mug and will therefore have more a bit more slouch.   
 
 
Sizes: Baby (Toddler, Youth/Adult Small, and Adult Large) 
 
Yarn:   Malabrigo Rios 100% Superwash Merino Worsted (210 yards/192 meters and 100 grams/3.53 oz) in 4 colors OR, any worsted weight yarn of your choice in 4 contrasting colors.  The following measurements are approximate and provide enough yarn for either the reindeer or cocoa mug design. Pom Pom yardage is not included.  
  
Gris (RIO212) [MC]— 23 grams/49 yards, (25 grams/53 yards, 46 grams/95 yards, 50 grams/105 yards)

*A note on yarn choice: If you want to get the most slouch bang for your buck, I highly recommend using a yarn that has some alpaca in it! I have found that alpaca really adds the best softness to your fabric to get that great slouchy drape. I personally prefer a yarn that is a merino/alpaca blend. The merino wool gives some nice elasticity (so that your hat doesn't lose all of its shape), alpaca gives you your slouchiliciousness (yes that's a word) and both are awesomely soft so you don't get the dreaded itchy hat head.*",7.0,666,753,4.81,"Fitted, Slouchy",Aran

**Pattern #46 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates


The seasons in Denali National Park come and go rather quickly. Well…three of them do anyway. The long cold winters of this Alaska park give way to a short spring where animals come out of hibernation and green begins to fill the landscape once covered in snow. A surprisingly warm (and slightly longer) summer beckons visitors from around the world while most of the park’s 400 types of flowering plants show off their colors. The short autumn brings swaths of orange across the tundra while bears feed on the last of the berries before hibernating once again and winter returns. Using nature inspired colors and fun-to-knit stitches, this design takes you on a four-season journey through the park from the wintery snowcovered landscape to snow-capped Denali Peakwith the other three seasons strategically and delightfully sandwiched in between.

642782,Koko Bean Hat,Judithmarieknits,1.97,4.0,1.0,Stockinette,,"Inspiration for the Koko Bean Hat:  Basically I made this hat with my son Kohl in mind, his nickname is Koko Bean.  His friend was at our home and had a hat on that looked very similar to this pattern.  We all loved it and I kept trying to get him to take off his hat so I could look at it and see how it was made.......it was a store bought hat and I wanted to make something similar for Kohl.  After quite some time he FINALLY took the hat off and YIKES.....all his beautiful blonde hair was buzzed off.  He pulled a funny face because he knew it would be a shock to everyone and it was.  (FYI...the buzz really looked quite nice on him)  So that's the story behind the hat.  BTW, Kohl wasn't around to model the Koko Bean Hat so his pretty wife is the model.  Kohls friend is the only guy I've ever seen wear this hat but it looked great on him and I would consider it for both guys and gals.

Update:  We went to temple square in Salt Lake City this year, to see the Christmas lights.  While we were there, someone walked by me and I thought, that hat looks familiar....after that  happened a few times, I realized it was the hat my sons friend had worn to our home.  I started counting each time I saw someone with that hat and by the time we were finished looking at the Christmas lights, I had seen it around 18 times.  Temple square is a big place and during Christmas it is packed with people looking at all the beautiful lights and nativities.....I only counted people who walked by me, so I'm sure there were a lot more of those hats there that night.  I was excited that lots of other people liked that style of hat besides me and I hope you will love it also.  (BTW, the four colors I saw that night were sage green, cream, plum, gray and mustard.)

This simple pattern is worked top down so you can use every single yard of a special yarn - the sample uses a cashmere blend, but this would work well with any light fingering yarn. Perhaps you have a special skein of sock yarn you've been holding onto?

Starting with DPNs, you’ll switch to circulars before finally using a tapestry needle to graft the live bottom stitches to the main body of the hat, forming a warm doubled-up brim.

**Tutorial for Grafting Stitches**

**Adapting This Pattern**
Here’s a fun tidbit I’ve learned about my own head: regardless of the weight of the yarn, once the “center square” reaches 4” per side, I can stop increasing and just knit straight until the hat is long enough for the brim. Now that I know that, I can use this same concept to make a hat from any weight of yarn.

US 10.5 – 6.5mm 16” circular needles

The 2024 Lonely Hearts Club KAL will be rolling around before you know it. We'll be knitting together in our Facebook group, [Nomadic Knits : Knit the World][2], as well as our [Ravelry Group][3].

 
2023's pattern, Ex's & O's, is a cozy hat designed to be knit in a wide range of sizes and is the PERFECT first step into stranded colorwork. 

There are only FIVE rows that require you to knit with two colors at the same time, and you never have to carry your yarn for more than three stitches. Slipped stitches create the majority of the colorwork.

Ex's & O's can be knit with a single strand of DK or with fingering weight yarn held double. You can also mix and match: use a single strand of DK as your MC and fingering held double as your CC, or vice versa.

If you're feeling spicy, you could marl your colors by holding two different colors of fingering together. Just be sure that your contrast color will achieve your desired level of contrast for the colorwork section.

Choose from a flat or folded brim.

**Size:** 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6); to fit Baby (Toddler, Child, Teen/Small Adult, Adult, Large Adult).

**Finished circumference:**  11 (13, 15.25, 17.5, 19.5, 21.75)”/ 27.5 (33, 38, 43.5, 49, 54.5)cm, blocked and unstretched.


**Finished height:** 6 (7.5, 8.25, 9.75, 10.5, 11)”/ 15 (18.5, 21, 25, 27.5, 28.5)cm, adjustable at brim.

To be worn with 0 - 4”/ 0 - 10cm of negative ease.

**Needles:** US 6/ 4mm or size to obtain gauge, in 16”/ 40cm circular and DPNs; and US 4/ 3.5mm or 0.5mm smaller than gauge, in 16”/ 40cm circular.

**Note:** You will need DPNs or a shorter cabled circular needle for working the two smallest sizes, as a 16"" circular needle will be too long.

**Gauge:** 22 sts and 28 rnds = 4”/ 10cm over Stockinette stitch.

**Yarn:** DK weight: 
MC: 45 (70, 90, 125, 155, 185) yards/ 41 (64, 82, 114, 142, 169) meters; and
CC: 25 (30, 35, 40, 45, 50) yards/ 23 (28, 32, 37, 41, 46) meters.
For the folded brim, increase MC yardage as follows: _ ( _, 35, 39, 43, 48) yards/ _ ( _, 32, 36, 39, 44) meters.


******* If using fingering held double, please factor that into your yarn requirements. If the yarn requirement is listed as 100 yards, you will need 100 yards of dk or 200 yards of fingering.

**Notions:** tapestry needle, stitch markers.

**Samples knit in:** [Lazy Bee Yarn Clover DK][4] (80% superwash Merino, 20% nylon; 250 yards/ 115 grams) in Valkyrie and Snowdrift, miscellaneous fingering from deep-stash in bright Magenta.

706936,Puff Stitch Hat,Deborah Kahn,2.4,,,,150.0,"This hat, in three sizes, is worked from the bottom up, in the round, with no seaming. The Puff Stitch pattern is fast and easy to knit, and using self-striping yarn highlights the pattern and eliminates weaving in extra ends.

I've been trying out other yarns. The  Louisa Harding Amitola Grande work better on size 8 needles and will come out slightly larger if worked on the same number of stitches. The pattern multiple is 8 stitches and going up or down one pattern multiple is the easiest way to adjust the size. Plymouth Gina is fine on size 7 needles, but I think it would make a nicer hat in medium or large. 

The puff stitch is very stretchy. Gauge in puff stitch should be 4 repeats in 3.5"" but that isn't an option in the gauge fields.

Two or three people asked about doing larger (or smaller) sizes of this hat. This is perfectly do-able but there are some limitations. If you use the same yarns and go up a lot in size the striping won't work with the puffs. Small and medium work pretty dependably, you lose a bit with the large size. 

Solutions:
1) Use a different yarn. Elegant Yarns Kaleidoscope works pretty nicely for an adult hat on size 8 needles. I think I used to make them on 72 stitches. The pattern has to be a multiple of 8 to work nicely. It can be done as a multiple of 4, but then the decreases at the top don't come out as nicely. 

2) Do the hat in a solid color, or do it as a scrap knit, using up small amounts of several colors.

The other thing to keep in mind if you want to make the hat bigger is that you need to do more rounds of puffs. ",3.5,277,66,4.67,"Newborn to 6 months, 6 months to 2 years, 2 years to 6 years",Worsted

The Hum Beanie has a flowy texture that is made up of right twisted stitches. I thought the design resembled little hummingbird wings, hence the name ‘Hum Beanie.’ It’s currently September here in Illinois and I’ve been slightly obsessed with watching the Hummingbirds in my yard. They’re so cute!

Just follow along to the corresponding instructions for your weight. I’ve added quite a few yarn suggestions, but feel free to check gauge for other yarns of your choice. Lastly, I added a link to my video tutorial for the Right Twist (RT).

**Not Included**

Provisional Cast on Instructions:

I did not specify a provisional cast on for this pattern.  Please feel free to use your favorite provisional cast on.  My favorite method is to start the project with a long tail cast on, then go back and unpick the cast on when live stitches are needed.

------------------------------------------------------

**Suggestions**

Size Large:

I did not include a size large in the pattern as I like my hats on the smaller side.  If you would like to try a large size, use the following modifications:

* Provisionally cast on 114 sts for your brim
* When working the brim decreases, omit the last decrease so that 96 sts remain",,457,439,4.74,Medium,Worsted

The **Seafield Hat** is a **unisex**, textured hat, knit in the round using Gansey-inspired stitches. It is first cousin to the [**Seafield sweater**][3] and second cousin [**Sea Whisper**][4]! ;) 

Wear it slouchy or turn up the brim for a classic watch-cap fit. 

Knit in the round from brim to crown, this adventurous beginner hat is worked with either two strands of yarn held together (a DK and a Lace), or a single strand of Worsted or Aran weight yarn. The lace silk mohair gives the hat extra snuggly-ness, whilst the single thicker yarn gives a strong stitch definition. It will definitely keep those cold sea breezes at bay.
 
It comes in four sizes including Child, Teen/ Small Adult, Medium Adult, and a Large Adult size.

**CONSTRUCTION NOTES:**
•	It begins using a 1x1 Tubular cast on. If this is not your thing, then use whatever cast-on you prefer, remembering to keep it as elastic as possible, e.g. long tail cast on is a good alternative.
Tip: If you find your tubular cast on too loose or flaring, go down a needle size.
•	Brim height can be adjusted. Please note that it you turn up the brim, part of the Wheat Stitch Pattern in the body will be obscured.
•	The pattern is charted from after the Body setup rounds. Please work from the Written Instructions until this point. Written instructions begin on page 4.
•	The crown decreases are worked back-to-back, and as such it is recommended to work the decrease stitches on either side of the markers tightly to prevent laddering.

---------------------------------

Thank you your interest the Scrappy Sock Yarn Preemie Hat. Let me tell you how I came to design this pattern.

In May of 2012, I was blessed to become a father. The kicker was that I wasn’t expecting to become a father until August of 2012! My daughter (whom we call “Blueberry”) was born two-and-a-half months prematurely, and as a result, she spent five weeks in the NICU before she was healthy enough to come home. We are very fortunate that Blueberry is doing well now, but those first few weeks of her life were full of ups and downs as we adjusted to what life is like with a premature child.

One of the high points that will always stick with me from our NICU stay was the night that we received a few hand-knitted and crocheted preemie hats for Blueberry. It happened in the middle of the night, when my wife and I were sitting by our daughter’s isolette, watching her sleep. One of the nurses stopped by, gave us a few hats, and went along to distribute hats to the other families. These hats were such a welcome gift for us. They were practical — hats helped Blueberry regulate her own temperature outside of the isolette, which allowed us to hold her — and they were whimsical and fun, bringing some joy and color into the NICU atmosphere.

As I admired these preemie hats, I resolved to learn to knit. I completed my first hat while Blueberry was still in the NICU. That started me on my knitting journey and I’ve been knitting ever since. I’ll never know who made those hats that brought so much joy to us, but they really made a big difference. I want to give back to the preemie hat knitting community, so I designed this hat to be able to take advantage of the leftover bits of sock yarn that seem to be so plentiful in a knitter’s stash. Each hat takes less than 15g of sock yarn. The stockinette version is especially well-suited for bits and pieces of yarn, if you’re up to joining in a new scrap when you run out of the old one. Sock yarn is machine-washable, which is a must for donating hats to a NICU. The resulting fabric is stretchy, so it is easy to take on and off the delicate heads of a premature babies, and does not irritate the skin.

One of the other highlights that will also stick with me from our NICU stay was the amazing support and encouragement we received from [Family Support Network of Central Carolina][6]. Their mission is to provide support, education, and caring connections to those who have a child with special needs or those born prematurely. When our daughter was in the NICU, she received excellent medical care through the hospital, and FSNCC was there to help us with the flood of emotions we were experiencing at the time. The more I’ve learned about the work FSNCC does — not just with families affected by prematurity, but also with families of children with special needs — the more impressed I am with the organization. That is why I am honored to now be serving on their Executive Board.

To help give back to the organization that means so much to me and my family, all proceeds from the pattern sales for this Scrappy Sock Yarn Preemie Hat will be donated to FSNCC. If you would like to support FSNCC directly, please visit the ""[Donate][7]"" page on their website.

**Pattern #2 in the original U.S. National Park Inspired line of beanies 
by Nancy Bates**

An up-close visit to the Great Smoky Mountains reveals a rugged and beautiful landscape of thundering waterfalls, clear streams, lush forests, abundant wildlife, and giant boulders. 
But . . . when viewed from a distance, this ancient range of tree covered mountains extending to the horizon is a study in subtle texture and gradient hues enveloped in a constant fog that visually softens the landscape. This beanie is worked from the bottom up using a variety of textured stitch patterns separated by narrow bands of stockinette stitch. The slight fuzziness of Alpaca fibers  ""visually softens the landscape"" of the beanie, reminiscent of the namesake haze of the park. 

NOTE:  These 3 colors of Woolfolk FAR have been discontinued.  Although any worsted weight yarn would look great, an Alpaca/wool blend creates the softened effect. 

This pattern calls for 3 skeins of yarn but you will not use the entire skein of any one color.

A miniature fleet of boats sets sail upon a slipped stitch band, bringing with it a bit of extra warmth for your ears. The intricate-looking pattern is deceptively simple to knit. Only one color is worked per round, so there's no need to carry two strands of yarn at once. 

Explore classic and exciting color pairings, add a contrast edge—or for a fun variation, introduce a new color for each set of boats! The slightly slouchy hat can also easily be customized to have more slouch, or to be a fitted beanie.

1106043,Clone Trooper Hat,Tanis Gray,4.05,29.0,4.0,Stranded Colorwork,,"Created from the DNA of bounty hunter Jango Fett, the clone army was secretly commissioned by Count Dooku and Chancellor Palpatine under false pretenses that it was necessary to protect the Republic from a potential future galactic war. Growing at an accelerated rate on the planet Kamino, the clone army numbered in the thousands and was trained to kill without hesitation. While identical in their appearances, a distinct white helmet and matching armor is worn by most phase one clones—a precursor to armor worn by stormtroopers later on.

Knit in the round from the bottom up, this bold unisex hat starts off with corrugated ribbing. High-contrast clone trooper helmets worked in stranded colorwork march across the body of the hat, just like they would in battle, while the crown decreases spiral upward in the main color. Attach a tassel or pompom to stand out from the other clones.

379719,Gnarly Hat,Diana Troldahl,1.85,,4.0,,,"This simple knit/purl variation creates curving columns that give the fabric an almost bark-like appearance. The resulting hat has warmth and plenty of stretch, so one of the five sizes will fit whatever head it ends up on. It can be worked in any yarn from worsted to bulky, by adjusting the cast on. Gnarly was written specifically for Wool-Aid (www.wool-aid.org), and because of the amazing stretch is suitable for any charity knitting.

Sizes:
Baby/Toddler (Child/Small Adult, medium, large, extra large) to fit 16 (18, 20, 22, 24) inches. The hat is knitted with approximately 3 inches of negative ease, medium will fit most heads. Actual circumference of hat, unworn should be 13-14 (15-16, 17-18, 19-20, 21-22) inches. 

Yarn:
80 (100, 130, 145, 180, 200) yards bulky-weight yarn is suggested. Worsted, Aran or Bulky yarn will work for charity knits, just choose the size needles appropriate for your yarn, then cast on the number one (for Aran) or two (for worsted) sizes up from the size that is your goal. Any cast on with a stitch count divisible by four will work.  Gauge is not important as long as you are getting a fabric you like. The overall ribbing makes this hat very forgiving regarding size

Tools:
US size 7 ( 4.5 mm) DPNs or circular needle for working the lower, brim section of the hat in the round.
US size 9 (5.5mm) DPNs or circular needle for working the main body of the hat in the round
OR use whatever size needles you are comfortable with for your yarn, that produces a pleasing fabric.

1211746,Mi Amaro,Thea Colman,3.0,22.0,4.0,ribbing on smaller needles and in cable pattern on larger needles.,225.0,"
Mi Amaro features a bold color and distinct lines in a twisted stitch cable pattern.  I'd been eyeing this motif (by the amazing Norah Gaughan) as a hat design for a bit, but it took me a while to figure out how I wanted play with it in crown shaping. The ""swirl"" of this pattern is just so gorgeous that I wanted to really bring it out as a feature. 

The result is crisp and unique, and the hat looks great on any gender - see the test knits! 

I chose Sea Change Fibers' Seacliff Worsted, a hand-dyed Rambouillet yarn, so the fabric is soft and springy - and I went for a real statement color with this deep red, called Dala Horse.

Cables are worked as twists in the pattern, and the pattern is both charted and written out.

**NOTIONS**
Crochet hook size G/6.0 (4 mm)
Several yds/m of smooth texture waste yarn in similar weight Stitch marker
Tapestry needle

**NOTES**
If you only have 1 yarn cake in one color you can opt to pull on the yarn from inside and outside of the cake while still alternating strands. This patterning doesn't work with one continuous strand of yarn.
Brioche/Tuck produces incredibly stretchy fabric, washing and blocking your gauge swatch is imperative to ensure the fit.

**GAUGE**
12 sts and 36 rnds = 4"" / 10 cm in Stockinette Brioche/Tuck Stockinette worked on smaller needle, measured relaxed once dry after washing and blocking
*Note that 36 worked rnds in Stockinette Brioche/Tuck Stockinette looks like only 18 Brioche rnds from the RS, because each stitch is slipped (or the equivalent) on alternate rnds.*

**Broch Beanie**
Bust your stash and turn your scraps into gorgeous hats for the whole family. The Broch Beanie includes 3 gauges and 6 sizes for ultimate versatility, so you can enjoy getting creative with the yarn you have. New to stranded colourwork? It doesn’t get much simpler than this 2 stitch, 3 round repeat. The easy to memorise pattern will allow you to focus on finding a comfortable style and easing into the soothing rhythm of alternating colours. 

The simplicity of the colourwork pattern creates infinite possibilities for combining colours and working with your stash. Highlight the graphic nature of the design with a simple 2 colour combination, or embrace the unexpected by reaching for a random colour for each stripe. Combining a solid colour with a handspun, self-striping or gradient yarn works beautifully, and, of course, Broch is perfect for advent sets and mini-skeins. The pattern includes tips for arranging colours and dealing with the ends in ways that won’t add a tedious chore before you can wear or gift your beautiful, completely unique new hat.

**Pattern #10 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies 
by Nancy Bates**


Bryce Canyon is home to the world’s largest collection of hoodoos, the oddly-shaped and beautiful stone columns created by thousands of years of erosion.  The tall spires (in layers of oranges, reds, and pinks) are so plentiful that it’s easy to see why the canyon is sometimes called “A Forest of Stone”.  This fun-to-knit beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) features layers of warm orange tones and subtle texture with understated vertical stitches creating off-set columns that narrow towards the top of the hat, much like the hoodoos they represent. 

This pattern calls for 4 colors of yarn, but you will not use the entire skein of any one color.

7297790,Candy's Fur Hat,Candy Grastorf,2.0,12.0,4.0,Stockinette,179.0,"This hat is very nice for chemo hats as it is soft and pretty!  They knit up quick & easy, about 2 hours depending on how fast you knit! There won’t be enough eyelash yarn for two, you can buy an extra ball or try doing stripes with your leftovers (or stretch it by alternating with plain bands of background).  I made 18 in three weeks so I challenge you to make at least one in the next month to donate! 

I have made quite a few of these hats & had fun using different colors of the background dk yarn and the **[eyelash/fur yarn][1]**. 

Color suggestion:  if you have a variegated fur yarn, pick one of the colors to use as the solid background yarn.  Check your stash (or check ravelry stashes for some of the beautiful but **[discontinued fur yarns][2]**).   
 
Note:  you want a loose, flexible cast-on.  I like the “Twisted German cast-on”.  [Video from VeryPink Knits of that cast-on here][3]  This hat will stretch a lot to accomodate various size heads so you want to be sure the cast-on will stretch also!  

You can make the hat longer and roll up the brim if you like.  If you have lots of hair or have a larger head, you can add 8 stitches and/or use a thicker background yarn. 

Two sizes.

This DK-weight hat features a quilted, slip stitch hat (*no stranding!*) worked in a pattern that resembles a large chrysanthemum-style firework at the crown—it's engineered perfectly to pack in all the Ooos & Ahs without the *boom!* that terrifies the neighborhood pups. 

The pattern is especially terrific for showing off a variegated colorway as the CC and is **designed especially for Miss Babs' Yarns new Rhinebeck 2022 colorway** to be released on Saturday, October 15, 2022.  The colorway is a SECRET prior to this date, so purchasers of the pattern will only get to see pics of other semi-solid versions of the hat.

Once the Rhinebeck 2022 color is revealed, I'll update the pattern with new photos showing off the colorway--it's SUPER PRETTY, and I know you're gonna love it:)

The crown decreases are engineered to serve as the floral center of the firework “bloom” as the slip stitches cascade like a sparkler.

The pattern is both charted and written out, line by line, and also  includes a table showing you what size hat you can make at 2 additional gauges (in case you want to use worsted weight, etc...)

**Pattern #48 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates

Beneath nearly 53,000 acres of woods, river valleys, and rolling hills in Kentucky lies the longest known cave system in the world.  With massive individual caverns and over 400 miles of passageways mapped so far, this park has definitely earned its name.  Visitors of all ages can walk next to an underground river, gaze upon beautiful cave formations, wonder at archaeological finds, scramble up and down hills, and even experience total darkness.  Using only 2 colors, this design begins with an easy to knit pattern representing the dozens of stairways found in the park.  A simple band of stockinette stitch leads into randomly placed bobbles reminiscent of the gypsum formations found on the ceiling of the famous Snowball Room.

<hr><hr><hr>

In the summer of 2022, I realized that maintaining a back catalog of hundreds of patterns was kind of overwhelming. I couldn’t do it and still release new things. So I took my old patterns down so I could keep doing new work. 

Since then, a handful of my favorites have [come back][11], and lovely new things have [come out][12]. But *the vast majority of the old patterns are retired and will no longer be generally available*.

***However, enough folks have asked about some old favorites that I’m planning to make many of the retired patterns available for a few days once or twice a year (most likely in late spring and then again in the fall around Thanksgiving).***

* **If you see the buy buttons on this page, you've caught it on one of the days it's available, and you're welcome to grab it!** 
* **If you don't see the buy buttons on this page, then it's not currently available.**

**Stochastic** adjective *having a random distribution that may not be predicted*

Ok look. Maybe you're currently working on something breathtakingly intricate. Something with beads and cables and lace and six different colors of yarn and steeks and very possibly a zipper somewhere in there.  And if you are, that's great! I'm happy for you! I hope you adore what you're working on!

But I? I kinda need to just knit. Just make one stitch after the other. No counting. No being glued to a chart. No hard rows where I need to make sure I have good light and my glasses handy. No cable needle to lose. Just knit and knit and knit. But with just enough going on to keep me entertained, because somehow I will get distracted if there's nothing but stockinette.

If you're right there with me, I think I have the perfect hat for you.

Work a brim (there are three different ones in there), then sit back and knit in beautiful, meditative stockinette until you come to a colorful stretch of yarn. Work a tiny bit of magic! Then go back the stockinette. Keep clipping along like that until it's time for the decreases (there are three different ones of those too).

It's quick and easy and yet somehow still deeply satisfying. I knit all three, and I'm still sort of wanting to make more!

<hr><hr><hr>

A quick note about the yarn: These hats were made with yarn specially dyed by Gauge Dye Works for this pattern. You'll find it [here][1].  One skein of that yarn will make any one of the three hats included in this pattern.

However, you don't have to use that yarn to make these hats. You can absolutely make this pattern with two (or more) yarns (a background color to work most of the stitches in and a contrast color or colors to make the fancy bits in) instead of one specially dyed yarn.  The pattern includes detailed instructions on how to do that.  

You'll want about 50 yards of your contrast color (or colors if you want more than one, it's fine if it's a bit less, this is a great way to use up leftovers from other projects) and about 175-200 yards of your background yarn. All the yarns need to be about the same weight as each other. And you can use any weight of yarn that gives you a fabric you like at one of the included gauges (that means pretty much anything from heavy fingering up through heavy worsted should be fine).

You can, if you're truly craving simplicity, even knit the whole thing in one single yarn with no color changes at all, which is lovely and understated! And there are suggestions in there too for how to use a long gradient skein to make something marvelous.  

Now, someone out there is probably wondering if a particular yarn in their stash with short bursts of color on it will work.  And the truth is, I can't say for sure. Both the size and the placement of the blips on the Gauge Dye Works yarn were designed with this pattern in mind.  I can't promise that other yarns with scattered bits of color will behave exactly the same way in this pattern.

That doesn't mean they won't work! The pattern is super flexible and quite adaptable, and I included a whole bunch of info on how to use other yarns, so there's a good chance they will! But it does mean that I can't make promises about the precise behavior of other yarns.  

I can tell you the yarn Gauge Dye Works yarn that was built for this hat works. I can tell you that using two separate yarns works. I can tell you that using one uniform yarn works. And I can tell you that there are a lot of ways to tweak the hats in the pattern.  But I truly can't tell you for sure if XYZ Yarn Company's new Wonderful Worsted in the Darn Nifty colorway will work.

But this really is tremendously flexible, and I don't think you'll have any trouble at all finding yarn you'll love it in!
  

<hr><hr><hr>

The hat is written in ten sizes (castons of 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, or 132 stitches), and you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the hat. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a fabric you like with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 5, 5.5, 6, or 6.5 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for your size.  With that range of sizes and gauges, the hat will fit a head between 19.5 and 25.25 inches (with lots of points in between).


And don't worry, the fancy stitch looks tricky, but it's shockingly easy. Plus I've got pages and pages of step-by-step photos to help you make it (along with blocking, troubleshooting, and yarn selection tips to make sure you have an easy time). You can totally do this!

<hr><hr><hr>

**This is perfect for you if:**

* You'd really *really* **really** like to turn your brain off for a few minutes and just chill
* You've suddenly realized you have the absolute perfect yarn for this

**It’s *not* for you if:**

* You don’t like charts (the pattern uses charts, but wow are they delightfully easy charts, so even if you're usually a little leery of them, I bet you can manage these)
* You hate swatching (you need to swatch to check your needle size)

Gauge isn’t’ make or break for this style, but I’m a tight knitter which means you may need to adjust your needle size. Also, since we are working with measurements & not counting rows, row height isn’t super important.

A raw wind carried the scent of seaweed and budding branches, warmed coastal earth. Crushed mussel & quahog shells dotted the shoreline. Feet tucked in warm boots and a favorite hat enabled exploring of both worlds, the wintry peaks and the awakening ocean.

With blazing colors of red, orange, yellow, gold, maroon, and purple as far as the eye can see, it’s easy to understand why Fall is the most popular time to visit this beautiful park.  Even an up-close view of a single leaf can reveal an unexpected kaleidoscope of color.  What an amazing example of the beauty of the changing seasons!  This beanie (knitted in the round from the bottom up) features three different leaf shapes and a simple fair isle design in 5 luscious colors to capture the warmth of the season.

*The Incredible Dr. Pol* on Nat Geo Wild is an Alexander family fave.  My daughter Maeve and I make a game of calling out the animal's ailment or injury and naming the procedure or medicine needed before we hear from the vet.  We love all the storylines, but our favorite is client Dave Aldrich and his reindeer at Rooftop Landing Farm. 

As fangirls, we decided to take a trip to Michigan to meet IRL the celebrity reindeer including Angel, Maeve's favorite. I’ve spoken with Dave, and while Angel is retired, he generously offered to give us a tour of the barn and meet her.

Not wanting to show up to the farm empty handed, I designed and knit this hat for Dave (and a few others) we ""know"" from the show. The name of the pattern is a nod to Dave's farm, Rooftop Landing.


Rooftop Landing is knit in the round from the brim up. It features a knit-in-hem for warmth and to help retain shape over time.

**Pattern #45 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates

Isle Royale is one of the most remote and least visited of all the national parks.  This rugged yet beautiful island rising out of Lake Superior near the Canadian border can only be accessed by ferry, seaplane, or private boat…and only during a few months of the year.  Once on shore, visitors are immersed in a land of wolves and moose, the only known place where these 2 species exist without the presence of bears.  The population of wolves and moose changes from year to year, creating a unique balance that’s been studied by scientists for decades.  Although the numbers of these animals seem great, you could spend 3 or 4 days on the island and never see either one.  But…the animal tracks along trails and shorelines serve as a constant reminder of their presence.  Using 3 colors inspired by the subdued hues of a foggy day, this design features bands of the tracks left behind by the elusive moose and wolves.  Can you identify which is which?

line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates

The old growth bottomland hardwood forest that covers much of Congaree is regularly flooded with waters from the Congaree and Wateree Rivers.  These floodwaters not only bring rich nutrients to the trees, but they also create a striped appearance on the trunks indicating recent depths of water.  In this fun-to-knit hat, lots of texture and cable patterns create a forest of trees embossed against layers of color from the roots to the canopy and the sky above.

“When I was swatching designs for this fall’s collection, I found myself again and again drawn to lace and cable combinations. After designing the Bray pullover I was still wanting to explore ideas with the same stitch motifs and felt that a matching cap would be fitting. The relief-like horseshoe cables contrast with the graphic eyelet columns and smaller cables to create a fabric that has textural appeal but remains light and open. The fabric has good elasticity and fits a range of adult head sizes comfortably.” –Jared Flood

My Man-Approved Cabled Hat pattern!

My fella asked for a fashionable, cabled hat, and this is what I whipped up for him. He loves it!

It's a really simple pattern and would be pretty straight forward to knit, even if you're new to cables. Nothing crazy here! Just one type of cable cross to learn, and you repeat that same one throughout the pattern. 

Although designed for a guy, this hat would, of course, be great for gals, as well. You can use double pointed needles or the Magic Loop method like I did, as you'll be working in the round. 

MATERIALS:
The updated samples are shown in colors: Musing, Grandfather's Library, and Beseech [Buttery Sport][3].

1 skein used per hat, approximately 250 yards used.

If those colors aren't available, any from [this category][4] will work.

*The original sample (taupe color) was made in a now discontinued yarn base.*

Enjoy!

 If you haven’t used mosaic knitting before it is the easiest way to add colorwork into a pattern - you never have to carry two colors at once.  

In this pattern you will only ever knit the primary color (black in the photos) while the other colors are a combination of knit/purl/slip stitches.  It is a relatively quick knit and the pattern is quite simple - perfect for TV based knitting.

This pattern will fit an average adult head (22.5"") but can easily be adjusted larger or smaller because the pattern repeats every 2 stitches.

You'll want about 150y of the main color and 25y of each of the four other colors.  Also, my knitting is usually looser than most people - make sure you test your gauge before starting.

**Pattern #59 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates


Jagged snow covered mountain peaks, high meadows and wildflowers, forested valleys, and over 300 glaciers have earned this park the nickname American Alps.  It’s the only place like it in the U.S. outside of Alaska. Melting snow and rainfall feed the hundreds of lakes, rivers, streams, and flowing cascades (the park’s namesake) while runoff from glaciers deposit a type of silt that gives the lakes of North Cascades their charactestic milky turquoise color.  In this design, simple stranded colorwork takes you from the meadows, to the tress, to the cerulean lakes and up to the melting glaciers and snow fields that feed them.


This pattern continues Nancy Bates’ series of 63 Beanies inspired by the U.S. National Parks. It was first released in the book **Knitting the National Parks**.

This pattern uses 6 colors of worsted weight yarn:

33g/66yds Color A
4g/8yds Color B
4g/8yds Color C
17g/35yds Color D
17g/35yds Color E

* broken rib slouch beanie
* seed stitch beanie with turn-up brim

Great as a charity knit as gauge isn’t important - the rib is stretchy widthways and the length is adjustable because of the turn up - and so fits almost any adult head.

Another great plus is that it takes only one 100g ball of chunky/bulky yarn and can be knitted up in just a few hours (especially as, unlike tradition ribbing, every other pattern row is plain knit!)

Immerse yourself in the captivating texture of Desert Rose Hat, a one-skein wonder that brings a touch of the floral desert landscape to your wardrobe. With just one skein of worsted weight yarn, knit a versatile hat that features a beautifully cabled texture reminiscent of the intricate desert rose.

**Construction Overview:**
This pattern is a no-fuss knit with rewarding results. You'll begin with a ribbed brim, then continue in the round, following a straightforward chart (or written instructions) that guide you through the cabled body to the crown which is knit with twisted stitches, designed to mimic the petals of a desert rose. It's a project with clear instructions, both charted and written, making it accessible for knitters looking to develop their skills or enjoy a quick knit.

**Specifications:**

- Yarn: Magpie Quartet Worsted - 100% Superfine SW Merino, 210 yds/100g. For best results, we recommend a yarn with at least some animal fibers, a nice twist for stitch definition and a semi-solid or tonal solid to complement and not compete with the cabled textures.

- Yardage:  180 (200) yards - 164 (182) meters.

- Needles: US 6 (4.00mm) 16-40"" circular for the brim, US 8 (5.00mm) 16-40"" circular for the body.

- Gauge: 3.5"" per chart A repeat (unstretched).

- Sizes:  Adult S (Adult L) - Width: 8.5 (8.75)"" [21.5 (22)cm], Length: 9.5 (10.5)"" [24 (26.5)cm], Brim Length: 2.5 (2.5)"" [6.5 (6.5)cm] remember, ribbing is designed to be stretchy and worn with significant negative ease, therefore the unstretched 17” circumference of the size small would be appropriate for a size 20-22” head and the size large is for up to a size 23.5” ish. Of course this easily adjusted by blocking and/or sizing up or down for your ribbing according to your tension for ribbing.

Desert Rose Hat is an ode to simplicity and elegance in knitting, perfect for those who love to see complex beauty emerge from their own hands.

Includes instructions for a toddler/small child & adult.
 
Free version of this pattern is available on my blog.

This design was inspired by my yarn of choice. I used Lion Brand Scarfie in Teal/Silver, and it reminded me right away of ocean waves. I chose to use a relaxed cable stitch to mimic the ever changing ups and downs of the sea. The name comes from the Roman Goddess Salacia, whom was believed to preside over the depths of the ocean.

Last night, near a hundred people were rounded up and arrested on treaties land. This pipeline's current path in and of itself is a violation of the treaties which protects waterways for sovereign nations. The granting of the easement to drill without an E.I.S. is also 100% illegal. If you knit one of these hats, please share this information, call your representatives, call Morton county, send letters, if you can travel to Standing Rock, get there. 


UPDATE 12.7.2016

I was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support for this project and wanted to give everyone who has been asking an update. As of now the best thing you can do to help this cause is donate directly so they can get firewood and other materials needed to avoid hypothermia in the ongoing blizzard. For anyone who has already knit a hat, or is currently knitting one, you can donate the hat to a charity of your choosing, or pay it forward by making a small donation to [The Oceti Sakowin Camp][1] 

Again, I thank everyone who has spread this pattern and the message behind it around. 

.....

This is a classic and simple hat pattern that I've been knitting for ages. I'm giving this pattern for free and you can make as many as you like, all I ask is that you pay it forward by knitting a hat for [Standing Rock][2] (or a shelter of your choosing). Winter is coming, lets keep our brothers and sisters warm. There are 2 sizes available depending on which weight yarn you use (DK or Worsted). The DK fits an average Small/Medium adult head and the Worsted fits the average Medium/Large adult head. Optional PomPom added for extra warmth. 

Please knit your hats out of wool or other natural fibers. Remember that synthetics are petroleum based products and keep us in an endless cycle of dependence on oil, supporting small scale wool producers helps communities around the world sustain themselves, and with proper care wool will last a lifetime, keep you warm, protect you from elements such as fire and water (which I am ashamed to say is a serious point of concern for the water protectors at Standing Rock), as well as decompose when it's time has come to an end. We CAN have a symbiotic relationship on this planet if we cared enough to really try.


SIZE
DK: 9 1/2"" high, 20-23” around (very stretchy). 
WORSTED: 10"" high, 21-24” around (very stretchy).

Pattern is written with a simple 12 stitch repeat and the decrease goes with each repeat, so it's easy to make the hat larger or smaller if needed!

Sometimes the hardest part of writing a pattern is naming it. Carly and I had difficulty selecting a name we liked for this one. So, we put it to our awesome DKA team; Carroll thought the pattern looked like geese flying in formation. 

So...we googled it and we loved it! ***V Formation*** for the win!

We can learn a lot about teamwork and cooperation from geese flying in V Formation. The lead goose uses the most energy because it is the first to break up the flow of air to give additional lift to the geese behind. When the lead goose gets tired, it goes to the back of the V, where wind is lightest and another goose moves to the front to take it's turn in the most difficult spot. By flying together and rotating responsibility, the whole flock travels 70% farther than each goose flying alone. Cool huh?

We are better together! Be like geese:)

**Pattern #43 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**
by Nancy Bates


The largest of all the U.S. national parks, Wrangell-St. Elias is SO massive, you can fit 6 Yellowstones inside its boundaries!  Four major mountain ranges meet in the park, creating a landscape of peaks, valleys, rivers, icefields, and  glaciers as far as the eye can see…and beyond.   As the glaciers carve their way across the landscape, scraping against mountains, they pick up debris and sediment, creating the stripes you see on the surface.  From the vantage point of flightseeing planes, glaciers take on the appearance of icy roads winding through mountain ranges.  With few roads and few visitors, those seeking wilderness adventures and solitude certainly find it here.  

Using only 3 colors of yarn, carefully planned colorwork creates layers and layers of mountain ranges atop a band of glaciers that resemble giant striped ribbons.

This is a stylish and modern beanie; one that a kewl sk8r boi might wear 2 the mall. This is a great beginner pattern and a quick knit.

**Size**
Due to the negative ease in this pattern and the stretchy nature of ribbing, Best Beanie will fit both children and adults. The finished circumference of Best Beanie after blocking is 17” with a maximum stretch of about 28” The depth is easily adaptable, knit shorter or longer as needed. The shallow depth called for in the pattern works well if you wear the beanie on the top of the head as intended, rather than on the back of the head.

**Yarn**
Fingering weight held double
or DK weight held single
or worsted weight held single

I like using fingering weight wool held double because I have lots of single skeins of fingering weight yarn in my stash, and because it creates a lovely texture. DK or worsted held single work splendidly as well, just get gauge.

**Yardage**
250-280 total yards of fingering weight yarn—held
double. (two 125-140 yard strands of fingering
weight yarn)

If using DK or worsted weight yarn held single you will need 125-140 yards.

**Tools**

* US 6(4mm) 16-inch circular knitting needle—or size needed to get gauge
* US 6(4mm) DPNs if you prefer DPNs to magic loop
* 4 stitch markers—one of which should look different to mark the beginning of round

**Pattern #29 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies**
by Nancy Bates

The Badlands are a perfect example of the rugged beauty that millions of years of geologic activity along with the effects of rain and wind can create.  The colorful and fossil rich layers and weathered formations reveal the history of a land transformed from inland seas and waterways to what we see today.  This beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) uses stranded colorwork and crossover stitches to represent both the layers and the distinct pointed formations.  The Badlands colorway was inspired by the dust swirling up into the blue sky.

***“A little more finished, a little more refined.”***
We fell in love with a handsome muffler in a favorite designer’s shop. On closer inspection we discovered that it was simply K2/P2 ribbing. What, we wondered, made this scarf so special? It was the finishing. The ribbing was pressed flat which gave the fabric a soft, elegant hand. We’ve added a companion watch-cap with a nice 4-part decrease that’s a little more finished, a little more refined.

**Pattern #18 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

This beautiful gem in Colorado may be one of the lesser known national parks, but it contains some of the deepest, steepest, and most spectacular canyons and cliffs in the country.  A perfect example of “art created by nature”, the famous Painted Wall, with its dark grey Precambrian cliffs striped with pinkish colored bands of pegmatite, stands nearly 1000 feet taller than the Empire State Building!  This beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) features nature inspired semi-solid colors with just a hint of sparkle to represent the mica found in the pink layers.

line of beanies**
by Nancy Bates


Great Basin is a diverse land from desert and forests to tall peaks to streams that flow inward and never reach the ocean.  Visitors can hike to a glacier, stargaze, take a scenic drive, look for pictographs, fish in a creek, see over 800 different plants, and even explore a cave.  But one of the most memorable and awe-inspiring experiences is a quiet walk among the oldest trees in the world: the Ancient Bristlecone Pines.  These gnarled, twisted, and wind-polished tress can live to be almost 5,000 years old!  Amazing!  Using colors that evoke a feeling  of solitude at twilight, this beanie combines two of the park’s most famous features…Bristlecone Pines and incredibly dark skies. 

Add stars to your sky-scape using silver or sparkly beads that are knitted in or sewn on afterwards.

This simple knit/purl pattern creates the texture that reminds me of the architecture in the PNW. This hat has a simple 6 stitch and 6 row repeat that is designed to keep it interesting, while being easy to memorize. This hat can be adjusted to fit any size head or knit gauge by casting on multiples of 6. If you want a shorter or taller hat, you can simply increase or decrease by knitting multiples of the 6 row repeat. You can even stop after row 3 if the hat is the right size.

The measurements in this pattern are meant to be guidelines. Please keep measuring your hat as you knit so that it doesn't become too large. Different yarns, a different knit gauge, will all affect the actual size of the hat. So use this as a template.

After knitting a ton of lace and fingering weight items, sometimes you just need to pick up some bulky weight and get something finished up quick!  :o)  This hat knits up in a single afternoon, and takes less than one skein of Madelinetosh Home.  

The ribbing allows for a lot of stretch, and so, while the hat is only 12"" in circumference, it will stretch and fit comfortably up to a 23"" head circumference.  The model has a 20"" circumference head.  

The beanie style uses roughly 65yds, while the slouchy version uses roughly 90yds.  That means that two skeins of Home will make two beanie style hats and one slouchy style hat.  Pictures featured show the Fluoro Rose colorway in slouchy, Fog colorway in beanie, and the colorblock version in beanie style.  

Gauge is not as important for this project, as the ribbing provides a lot of stretch.  However, if your gauge differs drastically from mine, you may have different yardage usage.

by Nancy Bates

There’s a place in west Texas where the desert meets the mountains, rivers carve majestic canyons, night skies sparkle with millions of stars, and (in early spring after the rain) bluebonnets line the roadsides and turn the hillsides blue.  This is Big Bend!  Knit in the round from the bottom up, this beanie features rich colors from the desert floor and bluebonnet fields to the browns and golds of the subtly textured mountains.  Simple embroidery stitches add dimension and even more color to the beloved state flowers of Texas.  

Pattern includes detailed instructions and photos on how to embroider the flowers.

**Pattern #13 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

The continuous bubbling movement and plop-plop sounds of mud pots are both fascinating and mesmerizing at the same time.  This constant geothermal activity creates circular patterns in the mud that shift and move next to and on top of each other as steam escapes up to the surface.  In this fun to knit beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) single stitch cables and textured stitches recreate the uneven circular patterns while the optional double wide ribbing keeps your ears cozy and warm.   

The multiple decreases, increases, and travelling cables in this design make it a little more of an advanced (but fun) pattern.

Do I realize that not everyone will want to walk around with two wee pointy bits (ears? horns? who am I to say) sticking up out of the top of their heads? Oh yes, that’s why I made them optional.

Am I going to wear them sticking out and absolutely revel in any funny looks they garner from passersby? Also very much yes!

But you, should you happen to be feeling a bit more subdued, can absolutely tuck them in if you prefer. The hat is equally adorable either way.

Don’t worry, you don’t have to commit to one option or the other. You can totally pop the points in or out as the mood strikes. And, as we all know half the fun of being a knitter is having truly smashing accessory sets, you can do it while sporting the delightful matching mitts!

<hr>

**General information**
This 24-page ebook includes patterns for both the hat (Decorum) and the mitts ([Comportment][2]). (The patterns are only available together as a set, they are not available individually.)

**Skills & scope**
These are pretty much exactly what I want in a project. Fun and easy with just enough going on to hold my attention, but not so much they feel hard!

For the hat, you'll start with a quick ribbed brim, then transition into two lovely cabled panels (to show off and keep you focused) flanked by stockinette (to keep things mellow and give your yarn room to shine), then do a quick bit of magic at the top to shape things up (I promise it’s not hard, and you will feel remarkably clever when you’re done). On the mitts, you'll do much the same (start with some ribbing, then a bit of cabling), just with an undeniably delightful thumb instead of a spiffy crown.

The pattern uses [charts][1], so you will need to know how to follow a knitting chart.

**Yarn, gauge & sizing**
The hat comes in five sizes (from a 116 stitch cast on to a 148 stitch cast on), and the mitt in six (from a 40 stitch cast on to a 60 stitch cast on) and both are written for five gauges (from five and a half to seven and a half stitches per inch in half stitch increments).

That means you can use just about any weight of yarn from fingering up through worsted, and there will be a size to fit pretty much anyone's head or wrist. Basically anything that will give you a fabric with a drape you like somewhere in that range of gauges will work.

The hat in the pictures took about 200 yards of dk-weight yarn, and the mitts took about 175 yards. If you're working with thinner yarn, 250 yards for the hat and 225 for the mitts is a safer bet.

**Tools & supplies**
You’ll need needles that let you work in the round (circulars or DPNs) in whatever size lets you get a solid fabric with your chosen yarn plus the general knitting tools you need for most projects (scissors to cut your yarn, a darning needle to weave in ends, a cable needle if you like to use those for cables, the occasional stitch marker or bit of scrap yarn to hold stitches).

Knitting is where love grows.

Whether you are knitting for yourself, or knitting for someone else, knitting is the surest way to show how much you love someone.

When you knit a gift for your friend, mother, partner, kiddo, that knitted object becomes a tangible expression of your love for them. Every time they put it on, they are reminded that you invested your time, energy and feelings into every stitch. They are held, kept warm, and made secure by those stitches. Each time they bundle up, they will think of you, because you took the time to think of them, to create a physical manifestation of your love.

If you are knitting for yourself, every stitch is a little bit of self-care. Every hat or mitten is an act of mindful time for you. You took a moment for yourself, to do something you love and make your world warmer and more beautiful one stitch at a time.

The Where Love Grows hat is a celebration of love. Knit in DK weight yarn, this pattern is fast, fun, and squishy. This 4-color stranded colorwork hat pattern includes a breakdown of the yardage required for every stripe and row of hearts, making it easy personalize this hat to fit your stash. The pattern is available in Child-Adult L, so you can knit a Valentine for anyone and everyone your heart desires.

*I adore designing projects when I adventure with knitters… I chose to design something small, portable, chock-full of learning, but in bite sized doses to allow for chillaxed cruise knitting. Since our cruise stops in the Shetland Islands with a visit to Laxdale Yarn, I knew their yarn just had to be part of the design!*

The Ultimate Hat is knit from the top down in the round. It starts with a highly amusing starburst knit with Jamieson’s Ultra, a scrumptious laceweight that feels almost as smooth as silk next to your skin. After the body of the hat is knit, you begin to work in the round inside out creating a thick and comfy traditional colorwork brim with 6-colors of Laxdale Yarn 2-ply Jumper. The decorative venting at the top is the perfect partner to the double layer at the brim.

This pattern uses fingering weight held double in three colors.  Perfect for any type of wool or acrylic blend since the fabric is intended to stretch.  Have fun choosing colors to marl, going high contrast for a graphic look, or low contrast for a subtle blended look.

1353398,Three By Three Hat,Galzanne Knits,3.17,28.0,4.0,3x3 ribbed,180.0,"Who doesn’t love a really nice fitting ribbed hat? 

My family and friends sure do and this is the pattern recipe for my favorite 3x3 ribbed hat. This hat was designed with a 2.5” folded brim. It’s a very stretchy hat and the smaller size will nicely stretch to fit up to 22” head. The fit for the smaller size on larger heads is snug so you may want to knit larger size for those larger heads! 
The pattern helps to guide you along to achieve the right length and the look and fit you’re after. There’s also a couple different options for decreasing the top of the hat. You might try them both and see which one you like best! 

I’ve knit this hat with several combinations of yarn. I recommend a yarn weight between sport and DK. Pick a needle that gauges close to 7 stitches per inch in ribbed pattern or gives you the fabric you like. 

This is a free pattern and has only had limited editing and 
testing. If you have questions you can reach me at galzanne@gmail.com.

**Pattern #9 in the original U.S. National Park inspired 
line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

Walking among trees that are thousands of years old, several yards wide, and so tall you can’t see the tops, definitely inspires a sense of awe and wonder in everyone who sees them.  The beautiful Giant Sequoias attract visitors from around the world!  This beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) uses a vertical stitch pattern to create the characteristic reddish-brown bark of these magnificent trees while simple bobbles add a fun texture to the treetops.

Based on finished fabric.",215.0,"The Upper West Hat is all about this cable motif - it's both delicate and bold at the same time, and it's so fun to work. After knitting an entire sweater in it, I really wanted just a little more. 

I love how it looks in this pale pink heather, with a deep folded brim and a distinct star-style crown. It gave me a few more days buried in this little motif and I was pretty happy. 

We will see if a cardigan comes  next.  

As many of you have asked, I'm wearing it with my [Armagnac Shawl][1], designed in Jill Draper's Mohonk yarn and it's one of my favorite knits ever! 

Cables are both written and charted. 

Notes are in pattern on how to modify for depth or circumference.

**Yardage needed per size:** 

185(200,215)yards

Yardage may vary with substitute yarns or modification.
If substituting, I suggest a worsted weight wool without too much drape. You need a little memory for a nice fit.  Colorway should be subtle if there is any vareigation to  show off the detail.

The Upper West:  

The Caramel yarn I used on the Upper West Sweater reminded me of a drink I had on the Upper West Side with friends a few years back. It had been a long cold day of Vogue Live, museums, and walking the city streets - so we ducked into a cozy bar. It was dark and warm and perfect, and somewhere on the Upper West side, hence the name.  

It had been a great day of friendship and adventures and yarn, and one of us ordered something like this that I have been obsessed with ever since.  I never managed to find the actual recipe, but I think I finally managed to make a fine substitute: 

**The Upper West**

2 oz bourbon 
1.5 oz coffee liqueur 
1 oz cinnamon simple syrup  
1 oz Cointreau or dry curaco
0.5 oz lemon juice
A dash of Peychauds bitters 

Shake all in jigger with ice and strain into short glass. 
Garnish with orange twist.  

***Cinnamon syrup***: Boil a cup of water, a cup of sugar and 4 cinnamon sticks in a small pot. Let cool. Take the cinnamon sticks out.  Store syrup in a sealed jar. Will last a week or two in fridge.

*There is a fabulous hiking trail at Fishing Point in St. Anthony. A staircase with 476 steps takes you up a nearly vertical mountainside to a beautiful 360° view. Before we hiked up the stairs, two humpback whales swam by. On the way down we saw a grey fox making her way up the stairs - she melted into the shrubbery before I could snap her picture. I found out later that Fishing Point is also called Fox Point. This is another iceberg watching spot, and there have even been sightings of polar bears.*

1285158,Bistripe Beanie,James N Watts,3.67,32.0,4.0,1x1 corrugated ribbing,258.0,"**BISTRIPE BEANIE**
Bistripe Beanie is a colorwork beanie that is as fun to knit as it is beautiful. Stripes intersect both horizontally and vertically to create a beautiful play of color in this illusion-like effect. Use this beginner-friendly pattern to try your hand at stranded colorwork; even tension is easy to achieve when knitting 1x1 corrugated ribbing. The recommended yarn—Iroiro by Daruma—comes in perfectly sized 20 gram balls, with many colors to choose from. This is also a great pattern for going through scraps, mini skeins, and stash yarn.

**CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNIQUE**
Corrugated ribbing video tutorial: https://youtu.be/L8PAo7cUbRg

This beanie is knit bottom up, in the round. The entire hat is knit in Corrugated 1x1 ribbing, a stranded colorwork technique wherein you change yarns between every stitch, using one color to knit, and another color to purl. Whichever color you are not using is “floated” in the back, so make sure to bring your purl yarn to the back of the work while working a knit stitch. Central double decreases are used for the crown shaping. The brim is finished by picking up and knitting stitches and working an applied icord. 

There are several techniques for holding your yarn in stranded color work. What works best for me is to hold my yarn that I’m purling with in my left hand, and my yarn that I’m knitting with in my right hand.

1298557,Waystone Hat,Alicia Plummer,3.0,16.0,4.0,Half Brioche,180.0,"*She tried. Really, she did- to avoid clumsily bumping anyone while navigating the crowded cafe. Her bags hung precariously from each shoulder and the straps were quickly slipping. Twisting, turning, and maneuvering awkwardly, she picked her way carefully through the maze of cafegoers and chairs. There was a small round table tucked away in the back corner. Just one chair- perfect. Her lips curved upwards at the corners, a seamless blend of self congratulatory relief. Hadn't bumped anyone today. ""Seamless-ha! Just like the new release..."" she applauded herself quietly. The money just wasn't there for a studio, and that was okay. An open, airy, big windowed studio facing the river from one of the historically preserved brick buildings downtown, with beautiful light puring in for photographing yarn and space for a loom... no, that was okay. One hour and a coffee in a to-go cup (even though she wasn't going, not yet) suited just fine for her. She preferred being around all the comings and goings. Smiles shared with strangers, voices and clothing and mannerisms all telling different stories- it made her feel closer to humanity. It felt a little less alone in here. Maybe it wasn't glamorous like that studio - but it was connection, and connection was special. She sipped her coffee and opened the laptop. The next hour was spent responding cheerily to pattern questions and emails, moderating the forums, and setting up test knits. By the end of it she'd lost track of time. Alarming! Her brows shot up as she clicked the laptop shut and shoved everything else back in her bag. Grabbing her hat and yanking it on, she didn't realize she'd put it on inside out. Good thing it was reversible.*


This hat is worked seamlessly in the round from the bottom up on one needle size. It incorporates 2 brioche moves but no brioche increases or decreases and is very accessible. It's an ideal beginner brioche pattern! Please weave in ends very carefully as it is fully reversible.

This one is simple in construction as it is just a play on a knit 3, purl 2 ribbing with dip stitches worked in the knit column of stitches.

**Details:** My friend Adella prefers to knit patterns that are easy to pick up and put down, that are relaxing on the brain, and chill to knit. I wanted to design something that would fit the bill for anyone with similar sentiments. It was a fun *and challenging* exercise to keep things simple. LOL! The beauty of this design is that the simple textures are a perfect way to show off a variegated yarn, a solid yarn, or anything in between. You could even bust some stash by using multiple colors because so little yarn is used, just ~1.5 to ~2 oz. This hat is sized for the whole family from child to adult. The ribbed panels allow for plenty of stretch.

The name was inspired by the colorway name Lemon Tart and because I wanted a hat that was easy going I went with the name Not Too Tart. 

**Size:** Finished measurements are 15” circumference and 9.5” tall.

another since the age of two. It was a necessary and desired

my deer-trodden moss beds, the ferns by the rock wall, my
Queen Anne’s lace, my yarrow. Inspired by this transition, I designed this hat, adorned with my beloved wildflowers, to represent the rewilding and growth of life.

Yarn Characteristics
MC yarns were bulky 100% wool in superwash yarns and lightly springy. Smoother yarns work best for the CC so the Fireflower petals can adjust to an attractive shape. It is possible to substitute two strands of worsted-weight yarns but you will need to twist/ply them together so they don't separate as you're working. I chose to do this so that I could take advantage of the fun glow-in-the-dark Lion Brand Yarn. See Pattern Notes for more details.

GAUGE

16 sts/30 rounds = 4 inches/10 cm in Fireflower pattern stitch using the larger size needle

PATTERN NOTES
[Knitty's list of standard abbreviations and techniques can be found here.]

If you're working with worsted weight yarn for the CC, you need to twist/ply two strands together. You'll need about 11 yards/10 m of twisted yarn for each time you work the pattern rounds. If you're a spinner, use your preferred plying method. If you're not a spinner, follow this tutorial for creating a twisted cord, using a hand-mixer. A device like this can also make the process easier.

Choose highly contrasting colors to make the flowers stand out. Two solid colors, or one variegated and one solid color work best. Two variegated colors may appear too ""busy"" and the flowers lose their visual definition.

The pattern uses only one color per round. The number of stitches on the needles increase greatly in rounds 2 & 3, and are decreased to the original number over the next few rounds. The added stitches are slipped and subsequently carried up over several rounds so they add minimally to the hat circumference.

Maintain your usual tension on the working yarn when slipping multiple stitches in rounds 4-7. This will draw the slipped stitches somewhat together. Do not float the yarn loosely as you would for stranded knitting, nor pull the yarn tightly.

There is a rapid decrease at the top for a slightly gathered look.

7305938,Smoked Orange Hat,Thea Colman,4.23,26.0,4.0,"Gauge given in cable pattern, and is based on final fabric. ",250.0,"
I had so much fun making the Smoked Orange Cardigan, and I had a bit of yarn leftover, so I decided to knit a hat.  And then I had a little more yarn leftover and I STILL didn't want to stop playing with the combination of stitches, so I made another. 

And now you guys have either a hat or a sweater (or maybe even both) to knit! A hat is the perfect way to try out this motif if you don't want to jump right in on the sweater.  Maybe you just prefer smaller projects, or maybe you have one perfect skein of yarn on hand. Either way, you've got options! 

I love the contrast between the delicate leaves and the thick, elegant cables in this motif.  I also love how the negative space here  adds such squish to the fabric. Since I've knit a sweater and two hats thus far, you won't be surprised to know that I also think this is really fun to work - the detailed leaf, then the big easy cable, then another leaf and another cable..  Once you get into the rhythm of this pattern, it's almost impossible to put down!    

The design is written so you can either knit your hat with a flat brim (as shown in the natural gray), or you can modify the pattern to add the deep folded edge (as shown in orange). Either way, this motif is great on a hat. It is happy either to remain squishy or to open up beautifully if you like a more fitted cap. The flat brim option is designed so the design comes right out of the ribbing, and the folded hem is just a big, cozy 1x1 brim. Both options feature crown shaping centered above the larger cables.

Cable pattern instructions are both charted and written out, and notes are included to modify for size. 

If you find this pattern in the future after this batch of the Midwinter Black and Blue is gone, a number of alternate yarns are noted above, and know that Estelle does get more of this yarn in stock from time to time when she can get her hands on the yearly clip! 



**Sizes**

18(21)”/45.75(53.25)cm hat circumference 
8(8.5)”/20.25(21.5)cm deep from cast-on edge to center of crown. Folded brim version is 10(10.5""/26.75cm deep, unfolded. 

Hat will stretch to fit when worn. 

**Yardage needed**

150(200)yds/137(183)m for flat brim version.
200(250)yds/183(229)m for folded brim version.

Easily available substitute yarns are suggested above and you can also check the test knits for other suggestions. For a hat, I really love a wool with a bit of memory. 

*If comparing the hat and sweater patterns, you may notice I've gone down a needle size for the hat, just to add that much more density and memory to the fabric!*

This little sheep sweater really began with the yarn. I could think of nothing more special to do with Sincere Sheep's naturally dyed superwash than to make a sweater to welcome a new little person into the world with. And if you're going to make a little sweater, you might as well make a hat to match.

The sweater's finished measurements are for a 17 (18, 19, 20.5, 22)” / 43 (45.5, 48, 52, 56) cm chest. 

The hat's finished circumference is 14.5 (16.25, 18.25)” / 36 (41, 47) cm.

To knit both the sweater and the hat, you'll need 2 skeins of your main color. In this case, I chose Sincere Sheep's color Virid.

line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates

Visitors to Kings Canyon are greeted by groves of giant sequoias before entering the spectacular glacially carved canyon with huge granite walls that tower up to 4000 feet.  A single curvy road takes visitors on a precipitous and scenic journey to a place of adventure and outdoor beauty. Inspired by tall granite walls and a hike near Kings River dotted with boulders, this design features earthy colors in simple stranded knitting. Three shades of grey give the illusion of layers of canyon walls and mountains viewed further and further away.

by Nancy Bates

From kite-flying and sandcastle building on the shore of Lake Michigan to hiking and camping in nearby prairies and forests, Indiana Dunes has much to offer families or anyone else looking for outdoor adventures.  Even the cold winters bring activities such as skiing and snowshoeing. From Fall foliage to Spring wildflowers, every season brings something new to explore.  In the subdued colors of a lazy summer day, this design features wooden boardwalk 
fences, grassy dunes, and gentle waves splashing against the shore. 


This pattern continues Nancy Bates’ series of 63 Beanies inspired by the U.S. National Parks. It was first released in the book **Knitting the National Parks**.

This pattern uses 5 colors of worsted weight yarn:

A preemie cap worked in the round from the brim up, with a yarn-over cable motif. Cables are ribbing, and the cables in this wee hat will expand as your tiny infant grows!

Before we met, two of my best friends had preemies. One preemie for Allegra, and two preemies for Lesley. When Lesley announced she was expecting, she expressed her trepidation that she may have yet another preemie. I began work on this hat knowing I was making a hat for a baby whose birth size was completely unpredictable. 

The solution: A preemie cap worked in the round from the brim up, with a yarn-over cable motif. Cables are ribbing, and the cables in this wee hat will expand as your tiny infant grows! Ideal for full-term infants too!

**Please work this pattern using version 4.1, as earlier versions have errors.**

886814,Dyea,Caitlin Hunter,2.52,20.0,4.0,colorwork (after blocking),223.0,"Dyea is a quick and simple colorwork hat, great for beginner knitters or gift knitting. It is named for Dyea, Alaska, a former Gold Rush town in the Klondike that is now a ghost town. 

The pattern has short floats and easy to memorize repeats, making it an excellent first colorwork project! It is also a good project for experienced knitters as a quick gift knit or stash buster. The pattern is written with the option of the folded or unfolded brim.

The sample pictured is knit in Lang Cashmere Light which is a very light, airy chainette yarn that could be knit in many gauges for different projects. I chose to knit it in a gauge that equals a DK yarn, making it easy to substitute your preferred DK weight yarn for this design. A great substitution is Pishkun from [The Farmer's Daughter Fibers][1] optionally held together with their Mighty Mo (mohair) to replicate the soft halo of the cashmere. You can also check the projects of my test knitters to see what yarns they used for inspiration!

I designed this pattern while teaching at [Hill Country Weavers][2] in Austin, Texas. This yarn was on display and was so unusual and luxurious that I couldn't resist buying some and impulsively casting on a new design right there! If you are looking for the exact yarn used in the original sample I would check with them!

**Pattern #27 in the original U.S. NationalPark inspired line of beanies**
by Nancy Bates

White Sands national park encompasses 275 square miles of the largest gypsum dunefield in the world.  The sand is so white, that most visitors say it looks like snow!  Inspired by the texture of windswept ripples of sand and shadow, this beanie features an unusual raised stitch pattern with small amounts of grey amidst a sea of white, resulting in a surprisingly thick and warm hat.  For a bit of whimsy, add an optional fluffy green pom-pom to represent the iconic soaptree yucca.

**A note about gauge and size**:  Although most of my designs use a size 7 needle for worsted weight, I went down to a size 6 for this one for 2 reasons: 1) For me, acrylic yarn tends to knit looser than wool and 2) I wanted the ""sand"" to have a smoother look.  If you choose to use wool or you are a tight knitter, you should probably go back up to a size 7 so your hat isn't too small.  Be sure to check gauge.

Aside from protecting the world’s most extensive Permian fossil reef, Guadalupe Mountains offers up canyons, forests, dunes, mountains, and incredible dark skies.  From the snakes and lizards of the desert floor to the bears and elk in the mountains, the wildlife is as diverse as the terrain.  A strenuous hike to the top of Guadalupe Peak (the highest point in Texas) rewards hikers with a breathtaking view – a view from the “Top of Texas”.  Inspired by the patterns and rich colors of the Southwest, the bottom half of this design features stranded knitting with duplicate stitch accents.  The top half features subtle vertical texture, representative of iconic El Capitan and Guadalupe Peaks.

1364203,Cloud Peak Hat,Briana Arlene,3.33,26.0,4.0,"in 1x1 ribbing knit in the round, after blocking",311.0,"*I designed this hat while in the Bighorn Mountains, much of which lie within the ancestral lands of the Cheyenne and Crow peoples. Named after Cloud Peak, the tallest mountain within this range, this beanie-style hat is a classic choice for chilly winter days. The allover 1x1 ribbing knits up quickly and lends a cozy fit. A leaf motif adds that little something extra to draw the eye and keep your interest as you knit, and the generous single-folded brim hugs the ears. This hat is offered in 4 sizes to fit children through adult x-large.*

**NOTES**
**Design & Construction:** Cloud Peak is a beanie-style hat with a generous single-folded brim. It is worked bottom up in 1x1 ribbing and features an allover textured leaf motif.

**Fit:** This hat is designed to fit with 10 to 15% negative ease. To pick the best size for you, measure your head circumference at the fullest point. Multiply this number by your preferred ease and then subtract the result from your head circumference. Make the size with a finished circumference closest to that number.

For instance, to make a hat to fit a 22-in. (56-cm) head with 15% negative ease, multiply 22 in. (56 cm) by 0.15 to get 3.3 in (8.4 cm). This is your negative ease measurement. Subtract this number from 22 in. (56 cm) to get 18.7 in. (47.6 cm). This is your ideal hat circumference. Size 2 has the closest finished circumference to this number, so you would make this size.

This is a quick beanie, knit in the round, from the bottom up.

I am offering this pattern for free with the hope that each person who downloads it will make at least one blue hat for [Hat Not Hate.][1] 

This hat is inspired by Jon Giswold, founder of Knit in the Pit, originally a local knitting group which became global through zoom. He started many messages to me with, “Hey there…,” and then would ask how I was, or ask if I could talk, or any number of things. But, it turned out he did that with everyone. He had the gift of making everyone feel like his best friend, like you were seen and important. He extended this focus and generosity to the wider community supporting Hat Not Hate, Knit the Rainbow and Soap S.A.C.K, along with many other organizations. I designed this hat with Hat Not Hate and Jon in mind; he loved bulky yarn, and seed stitch!

Decreases shape the crown. Beginning with Round 8, you will need to move and replace the stitch marker identifying the beginning of the round.

Due to its touch of nylon and the chainette construction, it knits into a gently springy fabric (with a lovely drape after a nice rinse).

This classic cap is worked in plush brioche stitch and incorporates thoughtful shaping details. With both beanie and watchcap variations offered in a size range from newborn to adult, Nido might just become your go-to style for the whole family.

The hat is worked from the bottom up, starting with a 1x1 ribbed brim on smaller needles. The brim is worked to a shorter length for the Beanie and a longer length for the Watchcap. A decrease transition round is worked between 1x1 ribbed brim and brioche body to reconcile the difference in gauges between these two fabrics.

The hat’s 5-point crown shaping incorporates double decreases to keep the brioche pattern unbroken throughout. A compound shaping curve improves fit on the head and provides a slightly ‘peaked’ hat shape when worn high on the head.

This sounds complicated, but I promise it isn’t.  Skenoto is a perfect pattern for an intermediate knitter or a plucky beginner.  Even if you have never done mosaic knitting, you will be able to follow this pattern as long as you know how to slip stitch.  Just don't forget - **always slip with the yarn in back!!**  

Be sure to read the pattern notes before you get started, a little preparation ahead of time makes all the difference in tackling this pattern.  

You’ll need two colors of worsted weight or aran yarn - about 75y of each color to be safe.  Be sure to test your gauge - some test knitters have ended up with MASSIVE hats!  If your gauge is correct, you'll end up with one very cozy adult sized hat good for men or women.

The recommended yarn for this pattern is Harrisville Shetland. I like Shetland for its excellent range of colors, and its woolen construction gives it a lovely rustic texture perfect for colorwork. You will need two colors. My sample was knit in White for Color A and Black for Color B. 
If not using Harrisville, choose another wool fingering weight woolen spun non superwash yarn. Choosing a yarn that is fuzzy and grippy, and not too soft or drapey is ideal for creating smooth stranded colorwork fabric.

The Kakano hat features a simple and intuitive textured diamond stitch pattern that is worked throughout after a nice pronounced rib body and the crown is worked in such a way that a nice star is shaped for a nice flat top.

**Pattern #6 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies 
by Nancy Bates**

At first glance, the saltwater flats of Badwater Basin (282 feet below sea level) look like miles of flat nothingness.  But, venture off the beaten path a while and you’ll find a surreal and almost otherworldly landscape of salt crystals pushing through the crust to form chaotic and beautiful patterns.  Knit in the round from the bottom up, this beanie uses single-stitch traveling cables along with strategically placed increases and decreases to recreate the “triple junctions” that naturally occur as the salt crystals expand.  The purposeful asymmetry of the formations gives this hat an organic look and feel.

Note:  I used 2 strands of the Queensland Rustic Tweed (light DK) held together simply because I liked the color.  But a single strand of worsted weight yarn will give the proper gauge as well.

We continue to be overwhelmed at the positive reception to our Year of Hats from 2019, and it was a no brainer to do it again in [Germantown Bulky][1]!

**Worthy of Note**
The Cliveden hat is the perfect, slouchy unisex beanie hat for last minute holiday giving. The spiral rib is fun to knit, which makes the gifting all the sweeter! Cliveden is worked in two different, but very similar, spiral rib patterns. The brim of the hat, worked in a spiral rib on a smaller needle, does not pull in as much as a traditionally ribbed brim would. You continue the same spiral pattern in the body of the hat, but a plain knit round is worked between each patterning round.

It can easily be shortened to 8–8.5” if desired to create a skullcap or toque. Simply work the pattern as written to 2” shorter than stated in the Hat directions. You can make a smaller version by omitting 8 sts at a time until you reach your desired circumference. For instance, cast on 57 sts for a hat circumference that is 16.75” (teen, small adult) and 49 sts for a 14.5” circumference (kids size).

There are four decrease points in the pattern, which are worked as double decreases. Be sure to work the decreases exactly as written to get the center stitch to be prominently centered in the pattern. When working the decreases, you must carefully follow the instructions to move the stitch marker at the end of the round one stitch to the left so that you are able to work the next following decrease round.

Balvenie is a beautifully simple, classic brimmed hat designed to show off the subtle shades of color in Harrisville's tweed yarns. 

It's based loosely on a cashmere hat I saw in a vintage shop years ago, and really just loved the lines of. I'm not sure how close it is to the original, as I never did take a photo that day, but the combination of simple cables, single ribs and a k2 has stayed in my mind for years. 

I of course, added my own thoughts - for instance, slipping the single ribs so they really stand out, creating a crown shaping that  showcases the distinct lines as they come together, and knitting a really cozy, deep brim so ears are always covered. 

It's a wonderfully unisex hat, depending on the color you choose, and you can adjust the fit as you like. It stretches around the head as needed, varying length is quite simple, and the brim can be worked as desired. Maya wears hers with just a little extra depth in the photos, while Phil's hat is snug on his head.

**Pattern #51 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates

The hot and cold thermal springs of this tiny park in Arkansas have been visited by humans for centuries.  As stories of the “healing waters” spread in the early 1800s, an entire town (including multiple bath houses) was built and the area became known as the “American Spa.”  It wasn’t long before visitors came from around the country to relax in the spring water and hike the surrounding hillsides…just as they do today.  Using 6 colors and simple stranded knitting, this beanie features historic Bath House Row surrounded by hedges, walkways, trees, and hillsides. 


This pattern continues Nancy Bates’ series of 63 Beanies inspired by the U.S. National Parks. It was first released in the book **Knitting the National Parks**.

This pattern uses 6 colors of worsted weight yarn:

20g/40yds Color A
20g/40yds Color B
17g/35yds Color C
17g/35yds Color D

I spend more time designing and working up samples for patterns that I have very little time left to knit. People often expect hand knit gifts as a result of my constant needle working, and I get a wee bit stressed come holiday times. My solution? Quick, easy, unisex gift knits that can be whipped up during a movie marathon. Thistle Cap works up pretty quickly – faster if you cable without a cable needle.

Thistle Cap is a unisex hat that is quick to knit and fun to wear – just look at the funny faces you can make while wearing it!

The Enchanted Evening Cap is a magical hat pattern that will become your favorite go-to pattern for gift giving or for yourself.  

Before entering this enchanted knitting adventure, you should know the basics of stockinette stitch in the round, picking up stitches, and decreasing stitches.  

If you have never made a double brim hat, I include instructions on how to do so in the pattern.  

For this charming hat pattern, you will need at least 65 grams of DK weight yarn.  In the pattern pictures, I used Kimber's Cozy Creations Tough DK in her self-striping colorway ""Practical Magic.""

The finished, unblocked hat measures 9.75"" across at the widest point on the brim, 10 stitches per 2"", and 15 rows per 2""

Because I am a loose knitter, many people have had trouble matching my gauge.  I've published a new pattern with options for small or large heads!  If you are a tight knitter DEFINITELY use the larger pattern!

---

This hat was inspired by the gates of the NYC subway at 205th Street station (Bronx bound D train FTW!).  I didn't realize until after designing this pattern that the same gates are used all over the subway system, but they will forever be my 205th Street gates.

Because the cabling of this hat is bunched together, gauge is SUPER important.  I am a loose knitter, so make sure you do a test swatch before knitting the hat (or you might have to give your hat away).

You'll need around 150y of worsted weight yarn and you'll want to be comfortable with knitting in the round along with cabling to complete this hat.",,208,391,4.61,Fits most adult heads,Worsted

**Pattern #23 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies**
by Nancy Bates

The smallest of the Alaskan national parks, Kenai Fjords contains the massive Harding Icefield which feeds dozens of glaciers throughout the park.  Many of these glaciers meet the sea, creating the iconic and unforgettable image of massive chunks of cyan hued ice breaking off into the teal blue water of the Gulf of Alaska. Further melting and breaking apart creates thousands of icy chunks in a speckled sea. This fun-to-knit beanie uses textured and vertical stitches, beautiful custom dyed colors, and just a touch of stranded colorwork to recreate this icy landscape.

With 95% of Biscayne's 173,000 acres under water, it's easy to see why this Florida park is so popular with divers, snorkelers, and boaters.  *Under* the beautiful aquamarine waters, visitors can explore a world of coral reefs and colorful fish, shipwrecks, and evidence of pirates.  *Above the water*, mangrove forests and small islands offer up adventures for nature enthusiasts, history buffs, or anyone else who loves a beautiful view in an amazing setting.  Inspired by the colorful coral reefs of Biscayne (and around the world), this design combines a variety of textures and carefully chosen colors to create a hat that’s fun to knit…and fun to wear.

Dive headfirst into brioche with Bluegrass Hat. Embracing the two-color brioche technique, this hat offers a captivating blend of texture, color, and technique. With its straightforward increases and decreases, it's an approachable project for first-time brioche knitters, yet remains enjoyable for seasoned experts. The pattern is complemented by comprehensive video tutorials, assisting knitters at every stage. The result? A stashbusting hat that's as fun to knit as it is comfortable.

The design keeps the crown elegantly simple, giving you the freedom to make it your own: top it off with a playful pompom or let its sleek design shine on its own. If you've got yarn scraps, this hat is your canvas. With minimal yarn requirements, it's perfect for using up those beloved leftovers. Plus, by alternating your foreground color every other round, the hat transforms into a mesmerizing kaleidoscope of shades.

Crafted for fingering weight yarn and including sizes from baby to adult, Bluegrass Hat is a versatile pattern that bridges the gap between traditional charm and contemporary flair. Dive in, and let this design be the highlight of your knitting journey.

**Construction:** Bluegrass Hat is a beautifully crafted piece that's knitted in the round utilizing the 2-color brioche technique. This hat is knit from the brim to the crown using fingering weight yarn. It features a Garter Stitch brim, a beautifully textured brioche body and some quick decreases for the crown that leave the perfect spot for a brightly coloured pom-pom.

**Yarn:** For this design, we artfully combined a medley of mini skeins and hues, transitioning the main color every alternate row. Nevertheless, we encourage you to tailor the color palette to your preference, using as many or as few shades as you desire.

This pattern is a lightweight version of my Spindrift Beanie and Cowl patterns that were written for bulky and super bulky weight yarns. This worsted weight version makes for a lighter weight hat, yet still super cozy due to the folded brim.

Knit cables are such a classic style, but this hat is even simpler to knit with faux cables created with right twist stitches. The faux cable stitch has always reminded me of waves and water, hence the name. 

This pattern is knit in the round, from the bottom up. The brim folds up to add an extra layer of coziness.

Size is adjustable by changing needle sizes or blocking or drying. You’re welcome to adjust chart design based on personal preference or experience with how many stitches you need to make a hat. It cuts down to 100 stitches by removing the mountains between Gandalf and Aragorn and a few single columns between certain characters and adjusting mountains above removed columns. 

Construction includes provisional cast on for folded brim. Single layer brim is up to maker preference. 

Ladderback Jacquard to catch floats would be great for this hat, although I did not use that. 

Main color: A Shortcut to Mushrooms on Merino DK by Long Dog Yarn’s One Club To Rule Them All 2022 subscription. 

Contrast color: Cascade 220 superwash in black. 

MC total used: 70 grams / 152 yards approximately

CC total used: 17 grams / 38 yards approximately 

Any DK/light worsted should work fine.

**Errata 2:**I have had some feedback regarding the baby-sized hat being too small.  I've made modifications to the stitch count and length of this size.  As of 12/6/11 the download reflects these changes.

This is a simple hat that utilizes helical knitting.  Sizes are for baby and young child.

These hats do not require a large amount of yardage.  You can make multiple hats with 2 full skeins or use up half ball “leftovers.”  The Small uses approx. 65 yards, the medium uses approx. 75 yards total.  You will use slightly more of the main color.

Of course, it can't be scratchy and it can't be too flashy and it can't be too bulky and it has to be long enough that there's something to pull down over the ears...you know this guy, right? 

This is a simple hat with great results. You can use the craziest hand dyed sock yarn in your stash or that skein of cashmere sock yarn that you know will just end up with a hole worn in it if you make socks out of it. It's the ultimate vacation or commute project because it takes up very little space in your bag and doesn't require your full attention to knit. It's all ribbing, and that makes it incredibly stretchy and hard to mess up.

The inspiration is a favorite knitting book, Sally Melville Styles, which celebrates knitting with leftovers to appear artistic rather than just practical.  The designs in the book are mostly garments, so, as an introduction to her artistry, I applied Sally’s inspiration to an accessory.  

The Fairly Scrappy Hat is knit in a classic stranded knitting pattern, but each 2- or 3-row set of blocks is knit with a completely different yarn.  The main color is carried up into the small blocks to ground the constantly changing colors and/or textures.  You are free to arrange your scraps in a way that pleases you with some suggestions to follow from the designer.  

With a fold over ribbed band and doubled yarn in the stranded knitting, this is a warm hat for chilly days.  For extra fun, combine your leftover scraps into a colorful pompom to top it off!

1240884,Forthwith,Hunter Hammersen,2.57,22.0,4.0,"1x1 twisted ribbing, blocked",250.0,"<hr>

I have a small weakness for speckled yarns. And by ‘small weakness for’ I mean ‘complete inability to refrain from buying.’ But, just to make things fun, I also have a hard time actually using all those gorgeous speckled yarns in projects. Because sometimes the lovely speckles I adore so much don’t play nicely with the complicated stitch patterns I tend to want to use.

But I’ve finally figured out the secret to actually using my (possibly alarming) stash of speckled yarns. The secret is (as it so often is) restraint. The secret is that you only get one showy thing per project. So if you’ve got some gorgeous speckles that want to strut their stuff, you have to give them a restrained stitch pattern on which to do it.

In this case that means a lovely long stretch of stockinette up top (speckled yarns really shine on stockinette). But I couldn’t knit a whole project in plain stockinette and retain my will to live, so there’s a rather delightful bit of dramatic swoopy business down at the beginning (speckled yarns will also generally behave themselves over ribbing and nice straight lines, assuming you make the lines long enough that they stand out against the exuberance of the fabric). And of course there’s a pretty crown and thumb, because why even knit hats or mitts if you can’t have those!

And don’t worry, you absolutely can make this with a non-speckled yarn and it will be lovely. But if you happen to have an opinionated yarn you’ve been having trouble finding just the right project for, this might well be it.

<hr>

**General information**

This 26-page ebook includes patterns for both the hat ([Forthwith][1]) and the mitts ([Posthaste][2]). (The patterns are only available together as a set, they are not available individually.)

**Skills & scope**

Sometimes you just want to sit back and let the yarn do all the work! A little ribbing, a lovely swoopy bit here and there, but mostly, this is just stockinette, giving those tricky yarns room to shine. No really, just sit back, follow the chart, and let the magic happen.

The pattern uses [charts][3], so you will need to know how to follow a knitting chart.

**Yarn, gauge & sizing**

The hat comes in four sizes (from a 104 stitch cast on to a 128 stitch cast on), and the mitt in three (from a 42 stitch cast on to a 50 stitch cast on) and both are written for five and six gauges (from five to seven and a half stitches per inch in half stitch increments).

That means you can use just about any weight of yarn from fingering up through worsted, and there will be a size to fit pretty much anyone's head or wrist. Basically anything that will give you a fabric with a drape you like somewhere in that range of gauges will work.

The hats in the pictures took about 200 yards of dk-weight yarn, and the mitts took about 200 yards. If you're working with thinner yarn, 300 yards for the hat and 250 for the mitts is a safer bet.

**Tools & supplies**

You’ll need needles that let you work in the round (circulars or DPNs) in whatever size lets you get a solid fabric with your chosen yarn plus the general knitting tools you need for most projects (scissors to cut your yarn, a darning needle to weave in ends, the occasional stitch marker or bit of scrap yarn to hold stitches).

<hr>

**Note**

The pieces of the set were initially available as stand alone patterns. Now that the set is out, the pieces are no longer available as individual patterns. But I wanted to make sure anyone who had one piece and wants the other doesn't need to buy the first a second time. So I set up a code that will let folks who already bought one pattern deduct the full price of that pattern from the price of the set.

To find the code, **make sure you’ve got the most recent version of the Forthwith pattern (an update went out on February 5, 2024), then look for the last paragraph of the Pattern Notes section on page two.** You’ll find the code there! It should work right now and will be active as long as the patterns are listed on ravelry.

This biodiverse park in the prairies of South Dakota is home to forests, grasslands, wildflowers, bison, prairie dogs, and elk.  Beneath all this beauty lies one of the longest and most complex caves in the world, Wind Cave.  Its name comes from the wind that blows from a small natural entrance to the cave, but its most famous feature is boxwork, the intricate and rare calcite formation found throughout the cave.  Using only 2 colors and an easy to follow chart, this design recreates the perfectly imperfect pattern in a fun hat that would look great in any colors.

**Saudade**
A slightly slouchy Fair Isle patterned beanie in one of my favourite colour combinations — grellow. Deep ribbing keeps things simple and streamlined from the front, with the colourful Fair Isle a beautiful surprise when you turn your head. 

The stitch patterns make a sampler of traditional peerie and “X and O” motifs that’s a fun way to try out stranded colourwork or to play with colour shading if you’re more experienced. Three shades of grey and two of yellow are used to subtly shade the patterns. Which colours are contrasted and which blended, which are background and which are pattern, changes throughout to create a lively sense of movement. The pattern is charted to focus on a pattern being worked against a background, rather than on individual colours. Work the pattern colour so that the yarn is dominant and use the blank columns at the side of the chart to plan out your own colour scheme. Don’t be afraid to rip back if the colours aren’t working but remember that a certain level of discord makes the patterns come alive.

* [Craft Yarn Council][1] - Basic guide - if you download the PDF and want to print the portion that contains the chart, print page 9. Additional baby/child size charts are on page 6. 

* [Bev's Country Cottage][4] - Pretty much everything you need to know if you knit knit hats for babies/children. On Ravelry, you can find her patterns [here][5]. Quoted below, emphasis mine. 

> Head/hat Size Chart - knitted or crocheted hats should be made about 1- 1 1/2"" smaller around than the head circumference, as the ***hats should stretch and sizes are not an exact science! If you make it, someone will fit into it.***

**Janet's Recommendation:**
Knit a swatch hat by casting on for the smallest size, bearing in mind that the smallest size might have to be knit on DPNs (or Magic Loop or Two Circulars). For me, 72 stitches requires DPNs - it's my preference. Because I typically do not like to knit baby hats on anything other than sport/DK, this means if I'm casting on 72 stitches, the hat will generally fit a newborn. 

Using the guidelines from the Craft Yarn Council, on their Head Circumference Chart, here is a way to determine what your finished hat might measure:

Baby - 14"" circumference means the *finished* hat might measure between 12"" to 13"" in circumference

Toddler - 16"" circumference means the *finished* hat might measure between 14"" to 15"" in circumference

Child - 18"" circumference means the *finished* hat might measure between 16"" - 17"" in circumference

Inspired by a love of skulls, and the forest.
This pattern includes 2 *separate,* but *similar* hat designs.
A folded brim and stranded colorwork keep this little project interesting. Knit one for yourself, and another for a friend... or one for each personality.

**SIZES**
Adult Small/Medium (Medium/Large)
Finished circumference 20” (22”) or (50cm (59cm)) 
Chart A – 9.5” (24cm) tall
Chart B – 8.5” (21.5cm) tall

**GAUGE**
Achieved using larger needle:
For S-M: 16 sts & 20 rows = 4” (10cm) in stockinette. For M-L: 14 sts & 18 rows = 4” (10cm) in stockinette.

**MATERIALS**
YARN – [Kenzie by HiKoo®][3]
50% Wool, 25% Nylon, 10% Angora, 5% Silk 50g // 160 yds

1 ball of each color per hat!

**NEEDLES**
For S-M size:
US 6 (4mm) & 7 (4.5mm) 16” (40cm) circular and set of 5 DPNs, or size required for gauge

For M-L size:
US 7 (4.5mm) & 8 (5mm) 16” (40cm) circular and set of 5 DPNs, or size required for gauge

**For both sizes**:
Crochet hook below US G (4mm) or tapestry needle for weaving in ends
US 4 (3.5mm) circ for picking up provisional stitches 6 stitch markers
Waste yarn for provisional cast-on

**ADDITIONAL** **INFO**
Chart A is longer, therefore slouchier, and gives focus to the lighter of your two contrasting colors.

Chart B is shorter, for a closer fit, and boasts a darker background to really let the pattern pop.

These hats are knit seamlessly from the bottom up and feature a slightly pointed tip.

Because of the long color repeats in some areas of the chart (11 sts at the longest), locking your floats is a very useful method to limit how many strands you will see (or snag) on the wrong side of your work.
You can choose to lock your floats after every other stitch, or every 5 stitches, whatever works for you! I locked mine after every other stitch.

1252486,Wildwood Beanie,Emily Sheehan,2.11,11.0,2.0,K1 P1 Ribbing,130.0,"This classic ribbed beanie is perfect for those who prefer a hat without a pom pom. The folded brim allows you to adjust the hat to be as fitted or poufy at the top as you prefer. Mirrored decreases add a little something special to this classic unisex style. 

This pattern is written for light bulky, bulky, and super bulky yarn. Yarnsub.com is a great website where you can find similar alternatives. 

Ribbing is a very forgiving stitch. I design my patterns to fit more snuggly at first, knowing they will stretch with time. If you like a looser rib, just size up your needles (knowing you will use more yarn if you do).

Be sure to check yardage requirements and the yardage of the yarn you plan to use. It's a one ball pattern with We Are Knitters The Petite Wool, but bulky and super bulky might require two skeins, depending on the yardage of your yarn.

*We want you to be happy 'cause this is your hat, too*

Love the look of Brioche, but not the slipping and yarn-over-ing of it?  This hat is the solution-- **All the fun of Brioche with less of the fuss.**  You won’t need to fish (*or phish*) for compliments for this one.
Worked up in either heavy DK or worsted weight yarn, this hat uses the Fisherman’s Rib stitch *aka Faux Brioche*—**no yarn overs or slipping!**  Instead, you knit or purl into the stitch below.  Need a video tutorial to show you how?  I've got you covered with videos linked in the pattern.

**Even better**, this design (basically ""broken"" faux brioche) has **no fancy brioche decreases**--Just some simple decreases to the crown within a single color round that result in a gorgeous ferris-wheel effect.  

**Materials**
Approximately 125(135, 145) yds of the MC (for the folded brim) and 65(75, 85) yds in the CC in heavy DK/light worsted weight yarn, 
Set of size 6 (4 mm) double pointed needles (dpns) or size needle required to achieve gauge, and

Don’t be intimidated by the twisted rib technique, it is simple to do and creates a cable like effect. The pattern is written for an adult size, 20-23 inch head circumference. The depth or ""slouchiness"" of the hat can be easily manipulated by knitting more or less rounds before decreasing.  The crown has very little decreasing and is therefore a great option for the beginning knitter.

We’ve created a four-color motif, which—as is traditional—uses only two colors per row. Then, we came up with three different color palettes and six different charts (two charts for each palette). And then threw in one more ‘plain’ chart, so that you can make up your own colorway!

This Colorwork Cap shines in a finer DK-weight, warm and woolly yarn with a great color palette. So we picked perennial favorite Rowan Felted Tweed!

This 4-page pattern includes:

**Six colored charts** showing the colorways we put together
A plain chart for choosing your own colorway
Tips on color dominance and choosing colors for stranded colorwork

**Special Techniques**—Swatching in the Round
Instructions for seaming, blocking, and finishing your piece

This hat was designed to resemble friendship bracelets. There are 3 different ""bracelet"" rounds included in this pattern. Each one includes instructions and a video tutorial on how to complete the bracelet for the stitches and techniques you may not be familiar with. The Braid bracelet also includes a photo tutorial. 

This hat is written for super bulky yarn (but also includes a note on how to complete an adult size bulky weight hat), and is written for 6 sizes baby 0-6m, baby 6-12m, toddler 1-3 yr, child 4-7 year, tween 9-13 yr, and adult

What you will need: 

Super Bulky Yarn-Malabrigo Rasta was used for color A of this pattern, but any super bulky size 6 yarn will work.  Yardage below does not include yardage for yarn pom. 
Adult-Color A: approximately 60 yds
Tween 9-13 yr Color A: approximately 56 yds
Child 4-7y- Color A: approximately 52 yds
Toddler 1-3y- Color A: approximately 45 yds
Baby 6-12m- Color A: approximately 35 yds
Baby 0-6m- Color A: approximately 30 yds
Color B, C, D, and E each require approximately 5 yds (will be slightly less for smaller sizes)
Needles: US size 11/ 8 mm and US size 13/ 9 mm circular needles 
Optional DPN’s 
Tapestry needle, Measuring tape, Scissors
Optional pom pom maker
Cube Letter Beads- I suggest these over circular letter beads because they have a bigger hole for your tapestry needle and yarn to fit through. I got mine from Amazon! These are optional as this hat can be made without them if you choose. These beads can be choking hazards for small children and should be noted with the sale of your finished products.

I hope you enjoy playing around with different colors and phrases as much as I did for this pattern!

In particular, I hope that it will bring comfort and joy to someone who is receiving chemo treatment.

The pattern is knit using simple stitches and features 4 pairs of large eyelets which allow you to weave in a scarf or ribbon.  Only 2 rounds out of the entire hat include stitches that may be new to you.   But no big deal.  

I've included photos of earlier projects on this page just to show examples of colors and materials.  Note that the 4th photo shows the hat embellished with a tie.  And the 6th photo shows the hat with a bandanna woven through it.

If you hate doing twisted stitches, then do this hat so you can get more practice and eventually love doing them. :) 

NOTE ON LENGTH: The first time I made this hat, I used Red Heart Worsted yarn and only did 4 of the pattern repeats. The second time I made it with Lion Brand worsted (pictured above) and I had to do 5 pattern repeats to get the same length. So, as you knit measure it at 4 repeats and if it's around 7"" at that point, then you might want to just do the final 4 rows then before the crown shaping. Thinner worsted yarn, though, will take 5 pattern repeats.",,127,292,4.66,"Adult small/medium, large",Worsted

**Pattern #30 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies**
by Nancy Bates

The famous Towpath Trail running alongside the Cuyahoga River (the heart of this park in Ohio) was once used by mules, oxen, and horses as they towed boats up the river through the historic Ohio and Erie canals using ropes.  Today, it includes nearly 20 miles (within park boundaries) of mostly flat trails for hikers and bicyclists. It extends for many more miles outside of the park. It's lovely at any time of year, but especially beautiful in Autumn as the leaves turn to shades of gold and orange throughout the park.  This beanie (knit in the round from the bottom up) features mini bobbles to add subtle texture to the foliage of the trees, while the splashes of color in Forest Path depict the fallen leaves on both sides of the river.

It should feel heavy for its size, it should be tightly knit, it should stand up on its own before broken in, it should smell like a sheep, and will probably outlast you.

(I almost always knit hats and mittens at a compressed gauge - we don't need drape for hats and mittens - we need warmth!) Beware - despite what many labels say, there really is a difference between ""Aran"" (usually 4 sts/inch) and ""Worsted"" (usually 4.5 sts/inch)  For slightly smaller hats for my (then-young) sons, I used worsted weight
yarn and compressed it a bit, too.

Look through knitters' North Star Hat projects and you'll see several have added an extra repeat for a 6-pointed star.  That's absolutely fine...**IF** you use a lighter weight yarn and knit it at a tighter gauge.  

Dale Hegre (Aran weight) and Freestyle (worsted weight) have been discontinued, so I've added several possible substitutes.  Just be sure that you're knitting the right weight yarn at the right gauge for your targeted size.
* * * * * * * * * * 
This is a circular-knit, two-color hat with a ribbed band at the bottom and traditional Norwegian-style stranded
knitting motifs covering all rows above. The motifs in the crown are shaped to form a 5-pointed star, when
viewed from the top. The I-cord and tassel are optional. The same set of instructions will work for knitting hats in a range of sizes, from youth through extra large adult, provided the gauge is adjusted, as indicated in the pattern. 

I used Hegre for the medium sheep heather #3841 / light sheep heather #2931 (beige/natural) version which was knit at the 4.5 st/in gauge for the avg adult size - not so coincidentally *my* size - *I'm keepin' it!!*  My husband's XL uses Hegre at its slightly looser ballband gauge of 4 sts/in. 

For my boys, I'm using machine washable, worsted weight Freestyle (see the blue/gold version), which will work well for either the average or youth sizes.  

In all cases, you only need 2 50g balls of yarn for the hat - 1 in each of 2 contrasting shades.  

Happy knitting!

**Pattern #5 in the original U.S. National Park Inspired line of beanies 
by Nancy Bates**

The tangled stilt-like root system of the mangrove forests growing at the water’s edge is one of the most recognizable features of the Everglades.  The nearly still water surface creates a mirrored image of sky, clouds, and trees with only the dark soil line to separate reality from reflection.   Whether it is worked in the traditional colors of the mangrove forests or something else entirely, the mirror image design of this beanie creates a fun and unusual take on fair isle knitting. 

This pattern calls for 5 colors of yarn, but you will not use the entire skein of any one color.

“Instant gratification.”

Warm weather seems to be a long way off. Mornings are frosty, the wind is chilly, the cold is nipping at our nose and ears... Well, we can take care of that! This basic beanie in a bulky wool will be on your head in—if not a few hours—a few nights of knitting. It’s a free pattern, so all you need to do is pick a color and then decide what sort of brim you’d like—the casual, rolled edge featured here? Or maybe a short band of ribbing? Up to you!

For a hat both warm and quick, we love Rowan Big Wool. It’s a woolly mammoth of a yarn at two and a half stitches to the inch (there’s the quick) and 100% merino wool (there’s the warm). We’ve chosen a mellow palette of colors—calm neutrals and a pretty bright.

I know. I know it looks kind of tricky right? Like you’re going to have to do something slightly unsavory with a cable needle. Or maybe like you’re going to find yourself doing a lot of counting and murmuring under your breath. Maybe even a bit of swearing if it’s been a particularly challenging sort of day.

But I promise it’s not.

That delightful little faux cable is actually shockingly simple (if you’ve done basic decreases like an ssk or a k2tog, you’ve totally already got the skills you’ll need, and the stitch diagrams will walk you through it so you won’t ever feel lost). In fact, the whole fancy bit is only five stitches wide and two rows high. That’s it…one teeny tiny fancy bit that you’ll have memorized in no time. Then you just stack it up, and it looks kind of amazing.

It’s that most magical of things…auto pilot knitting that manages to look really impressive!

Oh and you absolutely do not have to tell anyone how easy it is. You can just let them go on and on about how tricky it looks while you stand there feeling smug. Feeling smug is one of life’s little pleasures, and you can totally indulge!

<hr>

**General information**

This is a quickie (only 12 pages long and only one page of charts), but I promise it’s all you need. And of course that gorgeous little stitch is explained in detail, complete with illustrations of exactly how it goes together!

**Skills & scope**

This is a perfect example of how you can take a really simple framework (a ribbed hat), and add one tiny bit of fancy business (a spiffy little stitch) and end up with something kind of spectacular. If you can work in the round and do basic decreases, you can totally do this.

The pattern uses charts, so you will need to know how to follow a knitting chart.

**Yarn, gauge & sizing**

The hat comes in twelve sizes (from a 60 stitch cast on to a 115 stitch cast on) and is written for seven gauges (from three to six stitches per inch in half stitch increments).

That means you can use just about any weight of yarn from dk up through super bulky, and there will be a size to fit pretty much anyone’s head. Basically anything that will give you a fabric with a drape you like somewhere in that range of gauges will work.

The hat in the pictures took about 125 yards of super bulky-weight yarn. If you’re using thinner yarn, you’ll need more yarn! I’d recommend having 175 yards for bulky yarn, 225 yards for aran or worsted, and 275 yards for dk, just to be safe!

**Tools & supplies**

You’ll need needles that let you work in the round (circulars or DPNs) in whatever size lets you get a solid fabric with your chosen yarn plus the general knitting tools you need for most projects (scissors to cut your yarn, a darning needle to weave in ends, the occasional stitch marker).

**Pattern #20 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

Gazing up at the tallest trees in the world is humbling, awe-inspiring, breathtaking…and even a little dizzying!   Imagine looking up at a 35-story building and you get the idea of how tall they really are.  Found only in coastal California near the Oregon border, the Redwoods thrive in the perfect mix of rain, fog, and temperate climate where they live for 500 to 700 years on average…some even up to 2,000!  This beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) uses carefully placed rows of twist stitches to recreate the characteristic “twisted” bark of the redwoods while a simple vertical cable suggests the constant growth of ferns, smaller trees, and berry bushes that create the lush green backdrop of the beautiful forests.

From the minute Christina of Chelsea Yarns and I spoke on the phone about a collaboration, I knew what I wanted to design. I did propose 8 different ideas, but I thought I knew which one she might pick, and I was tickled when she did. She has a great sense of style and likes to keep things simple yet beautiful. The pearl details on this easy to knit ribbed hat add just enough class to put it into that category of a sophisticated piece that everyone will want to knit and to wear.

14 sts and 30 rnds per 4”/10cm (3.5 sts and 7.5 rnds per 1”/2.5 cm) in 1x1 ribbing fully stretched

NOTE: The gauge for this hat falls somewhere in between the two gauges listed above.  There is a huge amount of stretch that is allowed in a 1x1 ribbing so the knitter can assume a gauge of about 6 sts per inch when gently stretched to fit.

NOTE: This DK weight yarn is very close to a worsted weight; most light worsted weight yarns will also achieve gauge.

All samples were knit in Chelsea Yarns DK weight (225 yards/205 m; 100% superwash merino) AND Chelsea Yarns Luxe mohair (459 yards/419 m; 72% kid mohair/28% silk) held double.

Sample #1, Light Pink folded brim - adult x-small, in colorway Pink Peony and weighed 67 grams (41 beads weighing additional 11 g) using 150 yards of each yarn held double.

Sample #2, Light Blue folded brim - adult x-large, in colorway Robin’s egg and weighed 98 grams (56 beads weighing additional 13 g) using 220 yards of each yarn held double.

I hope you’ll enjoy putting color combinations together and feel inspired to dig through your scrap yarn bin and get creative! You can use all one color for the contrasting color, or use up to 3 (a different color each row) for a more colorful design. For a matching cowl, check out the Migrations Cowl pattern.

This is a fitted design. When doing colorwork, ensure that your stitches are not knit too tightly, or your hat will be too small. Gently stretching your work as you go helps, as well as steam blocking the finished product. If you’re still knitting too tightly, your hat is too small, or you like a looser fit; size up your needles or choose to knit the next size up. You can adjust the size by adding stitches in multiples of four.

This pattern is written for 3 yarn weights (bulky (weight 5), single ply bulky (weight 5/6), super bulky (weight 6))and 5 sizes, so the price is higher than my other patterns given the value you receive.

**SUGGESTED YARN**
*For the Traveler Hats I chose to use two of Brooklyn Tweed's classic bases - Shelter and Loft. I love creating versatile patterns that come with more than one yarn weight option and lots of sizes, so as soon as I finished my first Traveler Hat in Shelter, I decided to cast on another in its fingering weight sibling, Loft.  If you've heard me talk about yarn, then you probably know that my happy place is woolen spun yarns. Not only are they delightfully squishy and textured to knit with, but they are also very insulating thanks to having a core of air that is warmed by our own body temperature - creating the coziest of handknits!*

Grab this hat on your way out the door to play in the snow! It's got a double brim to keep your ears cozy, but the lightweight yarn won't make you hot when you're pulling your sled up the hill. It's got enough polish to wear around town, too - especially if snow is falling!

If you're new to cables, the simple ones here provide a perfect introduction.

The pattern includes four sizes, so you can knit this hat for kids and adults alike. 

**Difficulty:**  Advanced beginner.  The hat is mainly knit and purl stitches, with some simple cables. It is a good introduction to cable knitting. It is worked in the round.

**Sizes:** Child (teen/adult S, adult M/L, adult XL) with finished circumference of 16 (18.5, 20.5, 23)”/40 (46, 51, 57) cm

**Yarn selection:**Fingering/sock yarn. Approximately 50 (60, 70, 80) grams/220 (260, 300, 340 yards/200 (240, 280, 320) meters. 
 
**Gauge:**  28 sts and 36 rows to 4""/10 cm in stockinette stitch, unblocked.  

**Needles:**  US 3/3.25 mm or size needed to achieve gauge. This hat is worked in the round. A 16""/40 cm circular needle will be comfortable for all but the child size, which will need to be worked either on a 12""/30 cm circular, double-pointed needles, or a much longer circular needle, if you prefer the Magic Loop method. All sizes will need dpns/Magic Loop as the number of stitches decreases at the crown of the hat.

**Knitting support:**  Designer email is included in the pattern in case you have questions.

The Pillar and Post Beanie is a super quick knit combining a twisted rib stitch and slipped stitches to create a different take on a traditional ribbed beanie.  For my project, I used Malabrigo Noventa in Marte and Black Forest.  The yarn is billed as a super bulky, but you should be able to get gauge with a bulky yarn.  As different companies have wide ranges in what they determine as bulky and super bulky, take time to check gauge.

Hope you enjoy this instant gratification project!

Errata:  Updated pattern sent to anyone who received the pattern in the first day.   There is a fifth pattern row (worked the same as rows, 2, 3, and 4.   Please check email for updated pattern.  Thank you and apologies.

268220,Kami Hat,Katie Schumm,1.61,16.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,,"I have short fine hair that’s easily smushed, but in a Boston winter you can’t commute bareheaded. Kami’s reversible slouchy cocoon shape holds in warmth but never inflicts hat head. It’s a one-skein weekend project, ideal for unisex gift giving. The pattern pairs well with handspun or a soft Aran yarn like Yak.

NOTES: It's extra important to **block this hat.** It will help keep the bottom edge from rolling, it will accentuate the ribbing, and it will relax the yarn so that proper slouchiness level is achieved.

The other thing that helps keep the bottom edge from rolling (something some folks have had trouble with) is to use a **long tail cast-on** and leave an extra-extra long tail. Then knit the first row of the hat using the working yarn and the tail held together. This double-stranded first row also helps limit rolling.",,815,993,4.59,"20"" circumference",Aran

• uses stitch patterns to add extra warmth
• is knit with readily available yarn or yarn in your stash
• can be knit with wool, acrylic, or blends
• offers a variety of hat sizes to fit most head sizes
• has easy stitch patterns that are integrated into the body of the hat
• is easy to adjust for other yarn weights (other gauges suggested)

**All three For Giving hat patterns offer 3 brim options, 6 options for the body of the hat, and 1 simple decrease option — all in 5 sizes that will fit infants through adults. [For Giving 1][1] options include textured stitch patterns to add extra warmth. [For Giving 2][2] options include slip stitch patterns that can be knit using 1 or 2 colors. [For Giving 3][3] options include simple 2-color stranded stitch patterns (Fair Isle) that are suitable for beginners to Fair Isle techniques. Fair Isle stitch options include both written and charted directions. Patterns may be purchased individually or all 3 may be purchased as an ebook.**

All body options are multiples of 4 stitches and can be combined with any other body option. Make some for your favorite charity groups — and for your family and friends.

If you want to make the hat longer, you can either add additional ribbing rounds or add cable rounds to the beginning of the hat pattern.  For extra cable rounds, insert Round #26 just before Round #1.  (i.e. If you want to add 5 more cable rounds then add rounds 22-26 before you start round #1.

This super bulky weight beanie works up in a flash.  The design consists of left and right twisted stitches to give the look of cable knitting, but without the need for a cable needle.  I have added columns of slipped stitches to give a little definition between each stitch set.  Both elements combine to create a design that I think looks like Art Deco style palm trees.  I am a huge fan of art deco style architecture and I just love the use of bold geometric lines mixed with elements in nature.

Included with this pattern are video links to tutorials for the right and left twisted stitches.

1212168,Freja hat,Kristin Drysdale,4.25,26.0,4.0,colorwork,142.0,"My Freja hat is the last project in Chapter 2 of The Nordic Knitting Primer. I placed it there on purpose. Because the yarn is a little smaller, and the decreases happen while working colorwork,  this is the perfect bridge to more complicated knitting.  Hats make excellent colorwork projects because they are small. You can practice a lot of colorwork in this hat, and it will knit up relatively quickly. If you are new to knitting and new to colorwork, I would you suggest you knit one of the other projects in Chapter 2 first , and then knit this hat as a bridge to Chapter 3 and more complicated colorwork. As with  all of the other  projects in Chapter 2 of the Nordic Knitting Primer, all you have to do is knit what you see on the chart. It's still a straight forward simple knit. Just take the chart a row at a time.

Named after the Norse goddess of love, Freja’s crown has five stars that form a snowflake.The brim is circled with hearts that represent love and courage.  I would love to knit this hat in pink and red for Valentines, but for the rest of the year, I love gold and white for the rest of the year.

**Pattern #49 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates

No other setting conjures up images of a tropical paradise quite like the white sand beaches, palm trees, and crystal blue waters of Virgin Islands.  Add in 3000 years of human history, trails through varied forests, spectacular snorkeling with sea life galore…and you have a tropical adventurer’s dream.  No wonder this park attracts visitors from around the world!  Beginning with a band of lightly textured bougainvillea in the foreground, this design takes you to that tropical paradise of white sand, palm trees, blue seas, and sunny sky.  With a little imagination, you can almost feel the gentle tropical breeze.





This pattern continues Nancy Bates’ series of 63 Beanies inspired by the U.S. National Parks. It was first released in the book **Knitting the National Parks**.

This pattern uses 7 colors of worsted weight yarn:

Cloudfluff is a sumptuously soft hat with a double brim and a classic design. Worked in the round, it's a stockinette lover's dream, and one that you will want to cast on again and again. 

The pattern has been thoughtfully prepared with lots of detail.

* There are tips for casting on to make it easier to secure the double brim - no provisional cast-on required!

* The instructions include your choice of whether to join the double brim by seaming the cast-on edge (with tips to ensure a straight seam) or using a ""knit together"" method to attach it.
 
* The crown decreases have been optimized for a great fit throughout all 6 sizes

**Sizes**:  Child (teen, adult small)(adult medium, adult large, adult XL) with finished circumference approximately 16 (**18, 20**)(22, 24, 26""/40 (**45, 50**)(55, 60, 65) cm. 
Choose a size that is approximately 2 - 3”/5 - 7.5 cm smaller than the actual head circumference of the wearer. 

**Gauge:**  24 sts and 36 rounds to 4""/10 cm in stockinette stitch
 
**Yarn**  
*If using 2 yarns held together, as shown in the sample:*

* Approximately 35 (**45, 55**)(65, 75, 85) grams/ 140 (**175, 210**)(245, 280, 320) yards/140 (**175, 220**)(260, 300, 330) meters fingering/sock yarn 

*and*

* Approximately 20 (**25, 30**)(35, 40, 45) grams/155 (**190, 225**)(265, 310, 345) yards/140 (**170, 210**)(245, 275, 310) meters laceweight mohair/mohair blend.

The fingering-weight yarn used for the sample was Madelinetosh Tosh Merino Light, a 100% Merino wool yarn with 420 yards/384 meters per 115 grams. Other wool or wool-blend yarns would also work well.
The mohair blend used was Ella Rae Silky Kid, a 76% mohair/24% silk yarn with 219 yards/200 meters per 29 grams. Similar yarns include Rowan Kidsilk Haze, Friends Kid Silk, Valley Yarns Southampton, Drops Kid-Silk, and others. 

*You may choose to use a single strand of fingering/sock-weight yarn and eliminate the mohair.*                  
In that case, your hat will be less fluffy and the knitted fabric will be lighter in weight than if mohair is included, but the expected amount of fingering/sock yarn to be used will be similar to the amounts shown above for fingering/sock yarn. Disregard the amounts required for mohair. 

**Needles:**  US 3/3.25 mm, or size to obtain gauge. 
This hat is worked in the round. A 16""/40 cm circular needle will be comfortable for teen - adult XL. For the child size, you will need either on a 12""/30 cm circular needle, double-pointed needles, or a much longer circular needle, if you prefer the Magic Loop method. 
All sizes will need dpns/Magic Loop as the number of stitches decreases at the crown of the hat.

*Optional*: 16” circular or dpns one size larger than your working needle for casting on (see “Tips” in pattern).

**Notions:** Marker for beginning of round + 5 additional markers, approximately 1 yard/1 meter of yarn that contrasts strongly with your working yarn; tapestry needle.

**If you have questions**, my email is in the pattern.

Mt. St. Helens Hat is a cozy and squishy hat with easy cables and a deep foldover brim with a fold line that helps keep it nice and neat. It's inspired by the volcanic eruption of Mt. St. Helens in 1980 that spewed soft ash and altered the terrain for miles as the hot, molten lava carved out new gullies and deep ravines.
 
The hat is truly unisex, is offered in three sizes, and can be made in Worsted or DK yarn weights. Size and height of hat are easily adjusted (instructions are included). The size will vary depending on yarn weight and gauge.

Add a pom pom to top it off if you wish… maybe use a furry one or make your own.

Pattern is fully written and charted (including the crown!).

978615,The Patrick Beanie,Jan Rich,1.81,22.0,4.0,,200.0,"This is my first published pattern! 

I found this great skein of DK weight yarn in just the right colors on Etsy called Friday Night Fibers by Sharpin Designs and thought it would make a great beanie for my son Patrick to wear for his beloved Browns (whose team colors are orange and brown.)

First I found the Rhinefleck Hat and liked the look of it, but wanted the crispness of K1tbl x P1 ribbing for the brim, and I was not a big fan of the seed stitch ribbing for the body of the hat, so I guess I designed a new pattern, loosely based on the Rhinefleck.

This beanie is designed for a small adult head, and can be made bigger by casting on multiples of 8 stitches plus one for joining in the round.

I created this crown to maintain the 3 knit stitch ribs until the very last few rows and I love how it turned out!

I used part of one skein of DK weight yarn, or about 170 yards. After I test it using other weights and needle sized, I will add notes here.

If you’ve been following me for a bit, you know that I love creating pieces that can be worn in many ways and I love garter stitch with clever construction. Combine those interests with my love of using up leftover scraps, and you’ve got the **SPLIT DECISION HAT**. This hat can be worn in many ways, and it’s fun to knit. The finished product is just as pleasing in a single color as it is with color blocking or stripes. 

I love the multi-directional quality of garter stitch. Because the fabric is square, it is easy to work the fabric in one direction, and you can pick up and work in a perpendicular direction without much fuss in counting stitches. Simple shaping creates the crown in a non-traditional way. This is a great canvas for using up partial skeins, and the change in direction of knitting creates a unique expression of colors and stripes. Make a **SPLIT DECISION** about how to style your hat: with either side in front or even half of each side showing. I hope you love making this stash-buster hat as much as I loved creating it!

**YARN** 
I created this design using leftovers of DK weight yarn, all 100% Superwash Merino, ranging from 270 yd / 247 m per 100 g to 250 yd / 229 m per 115 g. Any DK weight yarn will work! Fingering weight can also be held double to achieve the DK gauge. 


An adult sized hat requires about 65-85 g of DK weight yarn. Mix and match colors as you like, striping partial skeins to make something truly unique. Each half of the hat takes roughly the same amount of yarn, so weigh your project after completing the first half to know how much additional yarn is needed. This hat is also a wonderful canvas to show off self-striping yarn and yarn with long color changes. 

**GAUGE**
19 stitches & 38 rows = 4” (10 cm) in garter stitch knit flat

**SUGGESTED NEEDLE SIZE**
US 6 (4.0 mm) or size needed to obtain gauge

**FINISHED CIRCUMFERENCE**
Sizes 1 (2, 3, *4, 5*) 
15.2” (16.8”, 18.5”, *20.2”, 21.9”*) / 39 (43, 47, *51, 55.6*) cm.

**FINISHED HEIGHT**
Short: 8.2-8.5” (20.8-21.6 cm)
Tall: 9.9-10.2” (25-26 cm) 

The short height may or may not have full ear coverage. The taller height can be worn slouchy or folded up. 

It is possible to create sizes between these as well by understanding your gauge and desired finished dimensions. Because garter stitch is so stretchy, this hat can fit a variety of head sizes. It can be worked with up to 4-5” (10-13 cm) of negative ease for a tighter fit or 1-2” (2.5-5 cm) of negative ease for a looser fit.

Make the most of Swish Pops’ many colors in this planned pooling hat! Planned pooling means working the yarn at a gauge and stitch count that causes the colors to line up with each other in an intentional-looking pattern. Depending on the colorway used and the exact gauge, this may be a wavy design, or it may resemble argyle or plaid, or it may be more of a color-block abstract painting kind of vibe. There’s no way to know what you’ll get until you start knitting!

The pattern repeat is easy to memorize as it is only five rows long and five stitches wide; the striking crown decreases are inspired by the wonderful Jacques Cousteau Hat.  The overall lace ribbing is also very stretchy and will accomodate a wide range of sizes, making this a great project for gift knitting.

Some tips for working the colorwork section: I do think this is a good pattern for first timers. For the chevron pattern- take your time. Make sure that the stitches you are stranding behind are spread out over the needle (not bunched up all together) so that you don’t pull too tight and create a scrunched fabric. If you wish to make the hat larger or smaller, you can add or subtract 6 sts from the overall stitch count and follow the pattern as normal.

If I could only choose one stitch to knit for the rest of my life, it would be cables. Okay, maybe that’s not entirely true. My first choice would be stockinette stitch for its versatility, but cables are a very close second. Cables are warm, cozy and gorgeous – what’s not to love? The details in this pattern look extra impressive, but they’re brilliantly simple to knit. 

Richly cabled with a close fit and folded brim, The Gansey Beanie will keep your interest without requiring a lot of extra focus.

Founded by Godric Gryffindor with a lion as its mascot, Gryffindors possess bravery, daring, nerve, and chivalry. Their head of house is Professor McGonagall, and their entrance is guarded by the Fat Lady portrait. Some of the most famous members are Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore.

Founded by Helga Hufflepuff with a badger as its mascot, Hufflepuffs value hard work, loyalty, patience, dedication, and fairness. Their head of house is Professor Sprout, and one of their well-known members is Magizoologist and author Newt Scamander.

Founded by Rowena Ravenclaw with an eagle as its mascot, Ravenclaw members are intelligent, curious, creative, and witty. With Professor Flitwick as the head of house, notable members are Luna Lovegood and Gilderoy Lockhart.

Founded by Salazar Slytherin with a serpent as its mascot, Slytherins possess ambition, leadership, cunning, and self-preservation. Their head of house is Professor Snape with famous members Tom Riddle, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Draco Malfoy.

House pride is very important at Hogwarts, and these hats help you show it off in style! Featuring a charted mascot for each house, this hat is worked in the round from the bottom up. Beginning with a short ribbed brim, the simple checkerboard motif makes it easy to size up or down, with four sizes provided in the pattern. A brave Gryffindor lion, cunning Slytherin serpent, wise Ravenclaw eagle, or loyal Hufflepuff badger are worked in conjunction with the checkerboard, while simple spiraling decreases close up the crown.

*The terrain grew rapidly steeper as they approached summit- steep enough to see through the treetops to the sprawling wilderness below. A crisp chill crawled slowly over the ground, matted with faded brown oak leaves and the occasional acorn. All of these would be delicately frost-etched by morning. The pair laughed as they ascended, stopping to admire dusk’s arrival through the leafless branches. For a moment their responsibilities and stresses didn’t accompany them, dropped somewhere in the parking lot like a lost mitten. They would be waiting to be rediscovered when the friends returned, but for now the two were lighter. Perhaps they’d miscalculated how much sunlight was left, they mused, as their breath huffed in joyful little clouds. The mountain’s shadow stretched deeper still across the lower altitude, nightfall cutting a crisp dark line through tree, dirt road, and lake. Further yet the horizon glowed in dissipating rose and peach, twilight developing like a photograph in a darkroom.
They were together, though, and that was what mattered. They were pines together on a mountain underneath the rising moon, and it was beautiful.*

7298115,Plymouth Gin Hat,Thea Colman,3.29,27.0,4.0,gauge given in cable pattern. Seen notes below for yarn thoughts.. ,230.0,"
The Plymouth Gin Hat is a unisex cap, designed to show off this gorgeous heathered Yarnadelic Worsted yarn from John Arbon Textiles. I absolutely love this combination of deep gray-blue with threads of rust in my skein, and it could not sit in my stash for a moment longer. (The shade is called Bada Di.) 

You won't be surprised to hear that heathered, classic yarn just begs for cables in my opinion so -- cables it is. 

I chose a motif  that feels traditional when charted or used alone, but the design has a little different vibe when placed side by side. 

The open ovals feature elegant lines and classic twists within their centers, but it's the way each lines up against the next oval that makes this hat so striking. The bold vertical lines allow for a nice contrast and create little diamonds as they come and go, and it's this combination of circles and lines and diamonds that make the hat really work for me. 

The cap is designed with a modern silhouette, including extra depth at top and a deep ribbing that flows right into the cable pattern on the brim.  

Depending on what color of [Yarnadelic Worsted][2] you choose, this hat can go from traditional and serious to bright and funky - and John Arbon has an absolute [rainbow of shades][3] to choose from! 

**Sizing:**  
17.5(20,22.5)”/44.5(50.75,57.25)cm around body of hat. 8.75(9,9.5)”/22.25(22.75,24.25)cm deep to center crown.  

Hat can stretch about 1""/2/5cm around head when worn, and notes are included about modifying for extra room around head or adjusting depth to crown if needed.   


**Yardage needed:**
175(200,230)yds
160(183,210)m 

Worsted weight yarn needed. I suggest wool or a wool blend yarn with a bit of memory when worn.  If choosing a substitute yarn, a tweed, solid, heather, or subtle semi solid will show off the cable pattern best. Exact yardage may vary with modifications or substitute yarns.

204435,Top-Down No Math Hat: The Manly Version,Suzyn Jackson Gonzalez,1.96,,,,,"I have nephews.  Three of them.  I have two sons, too, but they’re little and they’re getting hats with trains on them.  I also have two nieces, and, well, pretty stuff is easy.  But I have three nephews and the youngest one is ten.  They don’t want cute or funky – they want manly knits.

And so desperate times call for… new patterns.

Without further ado, I present my **Top-Down No Math Hat: The Manly Version**.  (Hint: it’s pretty much the same pattern, without the YOs.)

**Yarn:** again, whatever you like. Any weight – truly doesn’t matter. About a hat’s worth (I do this by squishing it in my hand and seeing if it kinda feels like squishing a hat. As you can tell, I’m a bit cavalier with my knitting.)

**Needles:** whatever the label calls for, or a bit smaller. You can use dpns to start, then switch to a smallish (24”) circular, or you can stay on dpns throughout, or you can magic loop it.

**Notions:** a tapestry needle and a freewheeling attitude.

The mosaic chart used in this pattern was designed by the lovely and talented [Karin Aida][1], and made famous in her [Ugly Duckling Socks][2] pattern. The chart is simple, yet effective, as the main color (MC) both frames and separates the color(s) in the contrasting yarn, enhancing or tempering the contrasting color (CC), which will transform it into the swan it wants to be.

As written, the hat measures 18"" -  20"" in circumference, and is stretchy enough to fit heads from child-sized to adult. Suggestions are given to increase or decrease the size, if desired.

This pattern can be knit with any bulky or worsted weight doubled yarn, and can incorporate scraps easily. Mosaic stitch accommodates different yarn thicknesses well, so many combinations can give a nice result. 1 100g. skein of the MC and a 50g. skein of the CC is all that is needed. Self-striping yarn works well as the CC.

Gauge can be anywhere from 3.5 - 4 spi, and 6 -7 rows per inch. Swatch for best results.

This pattern has been test knit.

Easily memorizable and totally addicting, this hat is just the thing to knit while sitting in the sun with a cold drink by your side.  Plus, the distinct lines in the motif make it easy to see where you are if you stop and start again.

I love how the lines of the ribbing curve gently into the motif, and how the crown decreases with bold waves at the top. The garter and lace diamonds look like cables, but are actually worked using yarn overs and decreases, paired with garter stitch detail. 

The hat is designed for two immensely satisfying yarns from A Verb For Keeping Warm.  In Range, (shown here) the heather of the natural wool and round, squishy feel of the yarn makes the lines of the motif just pop.  In Pioneer (see my other project), the light, airy quality of the fiber gives the hat a softer feel.  I know, because I knit the hat in both yarns.. 

If using Range, the hat needs just about 175 yards. In Pioneer, you will use almost every bit of your 160 yard skein.  

Both yarns fall in the light worsted/heavy DK weight family.  If substituting I suggest a lofty, round wool with a natural hand.  Depending on your blocking method, you can leave your hat with more or less texture when finished.  You can refer to the subs that the testers used as a guide.

In the summer of 2022, I realized that maintaining a back catalog of hundreds of patterns was kind of overwhelming. I couldn’t do it and still release new things. So I took my old patterns down so I could keep doing new work. 

Since then, a handful of my favorites have [come back][11], and lovely new things have [come out][12]. But *the vast majority of the old patterns are retired and will no longer be generally available*.

***However, enough folks have asked about some old favorites that I’m planning to make many of the retired patterns available for a few days once or twice a year (most likely in late spring and then again in the fall around Thanksgiving).***

This all started with that little gray and pink hat.  It was quick and fun and as cheerful as can be.  It would have been a lovely pattern all on its own.  

But I have a hard time knowing when to stop.  I decided we needed some options.  Before I knew what happened, this had gone from a quick little hat pattern to something a bit more fun!  

The pattern includes two different brims, three different bodies, and two different crowns.  You also get to decide if you'd like a straight or a folded brim and whether you'd like to work it in a single color or do a bit of colorwork.  There are *dozens* of possible combinations!  

<hr><hr><hr> 

The pattern is written in four sizes (cast on of 88, 96, 104, or 112 stitches), and you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the pieces. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a fabric you like with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 4.75, 5, 5.25, or 5.5 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for your size. With that range of sizes and gauges, the hats will fit a head between 17.5 and 26 inches (with *lots* of points in between). 

You can almost certainly make any size hat with less than 225 yards of the main yarn and 100 yards of the contrast yarn.

Sizes: The smaller sized hat is 20in (51cm) in diameter (on me in photos) and 23in (58cm) in diameter for a larger size (shown on husband) taken after blocking. Both are 9.5in (24cm) tall.

Yarn: Worsted weight: 50g (1.8oz) or 105yds (96m) of yarn in each of two colors (Patons North America - Classic Wool Worsted in Aran Tweed, Natural Heather, and New Denim shown in photos) Usually in brioche knitting, the lighter color is used as color A (I’ve used Aran Tweed here). But I’ve seen beautiful color combinations with the reverse as well!

Needles: size 7 (4.5mm) of length 16in (42cm) circular + double pointed for finishing or a larger circular needle if using magic loop method / size needed to obtain gauge.

**Pattern #40 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates

Named after the early French Canadian fur traders, this remote park on the U.S./ Canadian border in Minnesota encompasses 30 lakes and over 900 islands. The contrast between islands and water is so stunning that, when viewed from the air, the park resembles green puzzle pieces scattered across a huge mirror.  With a maze of waterways to explore, campsites and trails that are only accessible by boat, and a chance of viewing the Northern Lights, Voyageurs attracts visitors seeking both solitude and adventure…a true northwoods experience.  Using carefully placed patches of seed stitch against a background of simple stockinette, this design recreates the beautiful island landscape.  You won’t end up with 900 islands, but you will have 27!


This pattern continues Nancy Bates’ series of 63 Beanies inspired by the U.S. National Parks. It was first released in the book **Knitting the National Parks**.

This pattern uses 2 colors of worsted weight yarn:

The double-layered hat is worked seamlessly from start to finish in a single piece. Starting from 12 stitches, the hat begins with the Increase Crown (this will be the crown of the inner layer when the hat is worn). Next, a knit-even section is worked to the required length for your chosen size. Finally, the Decrease Crown is worked to mirror the shaping of the Increase Crown.

The completed hat resembles an elongated egg. Folding the hat at the halfway point, the Increase Crown is inverted into the Decrease Crown to complete your double-layered cap. The watchcap can be styled with or without a folded brim, as wearer prefers.

*“The delicate textures of this allover garter rib remind me of the gentle gridded surfaces of my favorite coffee-hour sweet, the Dutch stroopwafel. This squishy, seamless hat is comfortable and stylish. With sizes provided for newborn through adult, you can knit one for every member of the family.”* — designer, Jared Flood

It will fit everyone’s head like a dream, and the simple design will make it a staple for cold and breezy days, or whenever you wanna wear a cute beanie!

**Yarn:**
You can use any weight and any size yarn for this pattern! However, I highly recommend using fingering through worsted yet yarn for the best results.

The recommended yarn for this pattern is [Everyday Merino by Twice Sheared Sheep][1] (affiliate link)!

**Amount of yarn needed:**
The amount of yarn you need depends on what kind of yarn you use and your measurements. Average yardages needed per weight of yarn for an adult-sized beanie is listed below for your reference:
* Fingering: 350-425 yards
* Sport: 300-400 yards
* DK: 200-325 yards
* Worsted: 175-300 yards

**Materials:**
* Stitch Markers (3 in one color/design and 1 in another)
* Tapestry Needle
* Scissors
* Measuring Tape

**Gauge:**
You can use any gauge! However, it is very important that you gauge swatch and determine your gauge before working this pattern in order to determine how many sts and rows you need to work throughout this pattern to get the exact right fit.

**Needles:**
You can use any size needles for this pattern. I recommend using a needle size that creates a nice fabric with the yarn you’ve chosen to work with. 

In terms of types of needles, you will need:
* 16"" circular needles
* double pointed needles (DPNs) OR 36”+ circular needles to use with the magic loop method

You will also need an extra needle that is the same size as your main, working needle, or .5mm bigger or smaller. We will use this needle for the cast on method. 

**Techniques needed (step-by-step instructions AND video references are included for each technique):**
* Calculating math (adding, subtraction, division, and multiplication). I walk you through each step! If you are not a math fan, I also include a link to a Google Sheet that has all of the formulas ready for you. All you have to do is add your measurements and the math is done automatically!
* Stockinette in the round 
* Decreases
* Folding a brim

Stay cozy in this stylish and practical beanie and fingerless mitts set worked in two colours. The interesting textured stitch pattern helps to keep you warm and is simply achieved with slip stitches - meaning that you’re only ever working with a single colour per round.

The hat is given in four sizes, and the mitts in three so you can be sure of a perfect fit. The beanie is slightly long, perfect for pulling down over chilly ears or slouching further back on the head for slightly warmer days where fashion wins out over warmth.

This chevron patterned beanie is stylish, unisex and the ideal one-skein gift project. Perfect for new knitters this easy hat pattern uses only knits and purls to create the fun textured chevrons.

1106063,TIE Fighter Hat and Mittens,Barbara Benson,4.13,30.0,4.0,Slip-Stitch Colorwork on Larger Needles,,"Swift and agile with its twin ion engines, the TIE fighter is a staple in the Empire’s fleet. With room for only one pilot, this craft lacks both hyperdrives and deflector shields, making it unable to travel long distances. Its black vertical wings collect solar energy, converting it into firepower that shoots from its two lasers. With its unique shape and deadly fighting capabilities, the TIE fighter is a terrifying reminder of the power of the Empire—and an unforgettable part of the *Star Wars* galaxy.

Knit from the bottom up in the round beginning with easy ribbing, the hat shifts into a slip-stitch colorwork pattern forming tiny TIE fighters. Once the colorwork is complete, the hat continues into spiraling crown decreases. The fingerless mitts are also worked from the bottom up in the round with matching ribbing and slip-stitch colorwork patterning. Formed with simple M1 increases, the thumb gusset works up quickly, while the remainder of the fingerless mitt is knit in a ribbed bind off, making this unisex set perfect for space fighters everywhere.

*Divide is a richly textured unisex beanie worked in the round, featuring an architecturally inspired allover pattern of shifting parallel columns of ribbing and diagonal cables. Details like the tubular cast-on, seamless transitions from ribbing to cables, and hidden crown decreases yield a polished finished accessory with a stylish, ready-to-wear look. 
Version A is a modern beanie with a single brim, while Version B has a longer brim to be folded over and worn in the classic watch-cap style. Worked in a pillowy, woolen-spun chunky yarn like Brooklyn Tweed’s Quarry, Divide works up quickly and is as satisfying to wear as it is to knit.*

MATERIALS 
Version A: 140 yards (128 meters) chunky-weight wool yarn 
Version B: 195 yards (178 meters) chunky-weight wool yarn 
Recommended yarn is Brooklyn Tweed Quarry; samples shown  in colors ‘Lazulite’ (Version A) and ‘Alabaster’ (Version B). Similar single-ply, woolen-spun, non-superwash wool yarns may be substituted.
2 yards (1.8 meters) smooth waste yarn, worsted weight or lighter, if using optional tubular cast-on

SUGGESTED NEEDLES
Needle Size A (both versions):
One pair 16” circular needles and one set double-pointed-needles (DPNs) in size needed to obtain gauge (36”+ circular needle can be substituted for 16” circular & DPNs if using the Magic Loop method for working small circumferences in the round)
*Recommended size: US 7 / 4.5 mm*


Needle Size B (both versions):
One pair 16” circular needles one size smaller than gauge needle for tubular cast-on
*Recommended size: US 6 / 4.0 mm*


Needle Size C (Version B only):
One pair 16” circular needles two sizes smaller than gauge needle for brim fold rounds        
*Recommended size: US 5 / 3.75 mm*


GAUGE
16 stitches x 24 ½ rows = 4” square in stockinette stitch, knit flat on Size A needles (after blocking) 
32-stitch chart repeat measures 6 1/2” wide, knit in the round on Size A needles (after blocking)
*Please note, stockinette gauge is provided to aid in swatching for needle size selection only, as the pattern does not use stockinette stitch.* 

FINISHED DIMENSIONS
This pattern is written in one size; both versions measure 19 1/2” circumference, blocked and unstretched, to comfortably fit average adult head sizes 20-23”. Version A measures 8 ¼” in length, and Version B measures 8” in length with 2 3/8” brim folded up.

DIFFICULTY
Intermediate: Skills required for this pattern include casting on, knitting in the round, knitting cables, and decreasing. Instructions are provided for optional special techniques including tubular cast-on and cabling without the use of a cable needle.

Cable pattern instructions are provided both in charted and written format using common knitting abbreviations.

It works up quite fast and is a great way to introduce colorwork into your knitting if you haven't yet learned fair isle or brioche knitting.  If you're comfortable knitting in the round, knitting, purling and slipping you're reading for this hat.

This pattern calls for 50y of four different colors, but there is a lot of potential for interesting color combinations using more or less colors.

1081954,Basic Beginner's Hat,Maggie Billings,1.8,21.0,4.0,stockinette stitch after blocking,150.0,"This is a very basic hat pattern designed to help people who are learning to knit get used to common techniques including knitting in the round, purling, ribbing, and K2TOG decreasing. The instructions are written out with their abbreviations to make deciphering patterns a little easier. This is also a good pattern for more experienced knitters just looking for something quick, simple, and practical.

The pattern includes lengths for both a beanie (shown in grey) and a watch cap with a longer brim that gets folded up (shown in black.) Because it's about as simple a pattern as you can get, it's very easy to change the length of the hat to fit your needs. 

Since learning a new skill can be expensive, I suggest using cheaper yarns to help you get started. It can be intimidating to look at $20/skein yarn when you don't know if you'll even wear what you knit with it. These samples were knit with Cascade Pacifica and KnitPicks Wool of the Andes, both of which are around $6/skein. One hat takes about 130 yards of worsted weight yarn so you might be able to get two hats out of one skein. If you can, look for yarns that have organic materials as their primary fiber (i.e. wool, cotton, alpaca). Not only are these more sustainable, but they let you block the finished piece and are generally more comfortable and hold up better. 

If you enjoy this pattern, please consider donating a hat to shelter or organization in need of warm-weather clothing where you live. A wool hat can go a long way in a cold winter.

With Cloudline we challenged ourselves to design the perfect “first hat” pattern for a new knitter while also creating an appealing project for seasoned knitters as well. This hat is knit using only basic techniques: the knit stitch, the purl stitch, and the knit-2-together decrease and is the perfect project for practicing circular knitting (or for whipping up last-minute gifts!).

Cloudline’s bi-colored marl fabric is created by holding two strands of fingering-weight yarn together as you knit. 

The finished hat is fully reversible, featuring a distinctively different look on each side. 

This pattern is part of our *[BT by Brooklyn Tweed][4]* pattern line; a collection of skill-accessible knitting patterns written in a concise, visually appealing way. Each pattern offers a beginner-friendly entry point into the larger world of Brooklyn Tweed yarns and patterns. Projects you make from *BT by Brooklyn Tweed* will be straightforward to knit and fun to wear!

Teaching Beginning Knitting at the local library has allowed me to meet hundreds of knitters from around my area. We first began this class with a worsted weight hat but due to time constraints of 3 weeks, I decided that an Aran weight hat would be perhaps just a bit less knitting to finish more quickly. This is a good introduction to reading a pattern and is written using checkboxes for each round to be completed.

The Fireworks Hat is a bite-sized version of the Fireworks Cardi. This classic stitch looks amazing in multicolored yarns and one 100 skein of most worsted weights will make one cozy hat. Choose a solid or tweed for a classic tailored look or a multicolor for a bold look. The allover star stitch texture looks like a display of bright fireworks and is just as mesmerizing to knit.

*Construction Details:* 
The Fireworks Hat is worked in the round from the brim towards the crown. Smaller needles are used for the brim and the larger needles are used for the body and crown, as the star stitch is most comfortable to knit and wear when worked loosely.

Weight: Colors A and B each used 26 grams, Color C used 52 grams.


**SIZING**
One Size. Beanie is worn with a folded brim and slight slouch.
The combination of this stitch pattern and construction limited the stitch counts that could work for this design, so I’ve settled on a gauge and stitch count that will fit almost all adults and teenagers. Take a look at the dimensions below and if you strongly feel you need a slightly looser or tighter hat, experiment with tweaking your gauge with larger or smaller needles.

Finished Blocked Beanie Measurements:

Ribbing circumference: 16” (40.5 cm)
Body of hat circumference: 20.5” (52cm)
Total Length (with brim folded up): 9.25” (23.5cm)
For reference my head is 23” (58.5cm) around and this hat fits perfectly and would comfortably fit a larger or smaller head within a few inches.



**NEEDLES AND NOTIONS**
•	US 5 (3.75mm) 16 inch (40cm) circular knitting needles for ribbing, or needles 2 sizes smaller than what you got gauge with.
•	US 7 (4.5mm) 16 inch (40cm) circular knitting needles for body of hat
•	US 7 (4.5mm) DPNs or longer circumference knitting needles if you prefer magic loop for crown shaping. It is also possible to work magic loop on your 16 inch (40 cm) circular needles, though it is not very comfortable
•	3 locking/removable stitch markers to mark decrease points
•	1 ring stitch marker to mark beginning of round
•	Tapestry or Darning needle for weaving in ends
•	Pompom maker if you want to make a pompom, you can also DIY this but I like using the tool.

This beginner-friendly, easy cable knitting pattern is written in US terms (English) and is perfect for market prep because it absolutely flies off the needles. It is a super quick knit in the round, especially in super bulky! And, though written for bulky and super bulky yarn, it easily lends itself to other weights and sizes with its simple four-stitch repeat over 10 rounds. 

Helpful tables, charts and video tutorials are included taking any guess-work out of the equation. New to cabling? Got you covered and you'll even be shown how to do it without a cable needle. You will be amazed how easy it is! The end result is a beautifully bulky, textured beanie that is quick to make, a pleasure to knit and superbly warm to wear!

The SUNNY SPOT hat is an extraordinarily FAST project! I love bulky weight hats! They fly off the needles, and create a sweet, quick, sunny spot between larger knitting projects. This project is great for using up scraps of bulky weight yarn or bulky weight mini skeins. Don't have any bulky weight yarn? Consider holding multiple strands of lighter weight yarn together.

This hat is knit seamlessly from the bottom up, in the round. This hat features fun, graphic colorwork, and you NEVER need to catch a float. Looking for a project that you can knit in less than a day? This project is for you!

Because it is intended for a beginner who may have limited supplies and/or abilities, the pattern is written as simply as possible and includes detailed instructions and explanations.  When applicable, optional instructions are provided for those who wish and are able to add them.  

This pattern is offered free, but if you would like to [donate or buy me a cup of coffee][1], I would appreciate it!

At gauge, the circumference will be approximately 17” (19”) unstretched for the hat body.  Because the brim is knit in 2x2 ribbing, it has a wide range of stretch and fit.

This hat is knit from the brim to the crown.  Instructions are given to adjust the length to fit close to the crown of the head (beanie) or with extra length (slouch).  


**Materials:**

* 100 grams (200-220 yards) worsted weight yarn
* US size 6 (4 mm) 16” circular needle
* US size 6 (4 mm) set of double pointed needles (dpns)
* 1 stitch marker *(optional – 6 (7) additional markers for crown decreases)*

We continue to be overwhelmed at the positive reception to our Year of Hats from 2019, and it was a no brainer to do it again in [Germantown Bulky][1]!

**Worthy of Note**
This heavily textured hat is knit in the round from the bottom up. After working a slipped stitch ribbing brim, the Anemone Stitch is worked for the body of the hat. Once the Anemone Stitch has been established, you will need to move the marker identifying the beginning of the round at the start of Rounds 2 and 4 in order to keep the anemone clusters in the correct position. Due to the nature of the decreases, you will not need to move the marker when working the crown.

45,We Call Them Pirates,Adrian Bizilia,4.03,6.0,1.0,,,"Adrian says: ""The man in the photo, Mr. HelloYarn, has a 23"" head, measured where the base of the hat sits.  This allows 2"" of negative ease for the hat, so that it doesn't stretch out and get too loose after a bit of wear.  I have, however, been very sure when knitting to leave nice, long floats when switching colors, which leaves the fabric with good stretch.  If you are new to color knitting, be sure to spread the stitches on your right hand needle out before you make a stitch in a new color. This makes sure your floats are long enough (they should ideally hump out a little bit to allow the fabric to stretch).""

I made two examples of the hat, both in Bulky yarn. Unfortunately both yarns are now discontinued, but most any lofty, stretchy bulky yarn would look great. This is a great ""one-skein-wonder"" hat. I used 130 yards for each hat, but estimated up so you don't run out of yarn.

Who needs a ruler and compass to make geometric constructions! Enjoy stranded two-color knitting in its simplest form, and challenge yourself to try out unexpected color combinations. Lineate is a fun exploration of parallel and perpendicular lines—and there might even be a hidden bit of Fibonacci in those stripes!

The narrow ribbing at the bottom edge is perfect for a fun pop of color, and the transitions in the stripe patterns will keep you going. Add a pompom, or just let the concentric circles of the crown decreases have the last word.

**Pattern #52 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates

The Green and Colorado Rivers have been carving out canyons in the high desert of southeast Utah for millions of years.  The forces of erosion and the wonders of geologic movement continue to shape the mesas, buttes, spires, and arches of the Canyonlands we see today.  The resulting landscape is the ideal location for adventures of all types or even a simple drive along the paved park road with its many overlooks.  Using rich colors and simple stitches, you can recreate one of these amazing overlook views from the vertical texture of the canyon walls to the smooth mesa tops. 


This pattern continues Nancy Bates’ series of 63 Beanies inspired by the U.S. National Parks. It was first released in the book **Knitting the National Parks**.

This pattern uses 2 colors of worsted weight yarn:

The hat was made with stash remnants from the mittens from 2015!

I made my first two pairs of Deathflake mittens in 2015 and haven't found a hat I like to match my pair made with Knit Picks Chroma Groovy.   So I designed a pattern that uses elements from the mittens so it matches but has a small design difference to make it unique.

~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~

I’ve been knitting hats for quite some time and many of the hats I have knitted have been to donate to local hospitals for the premature babies in their Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

Side note: I spent two years as a hospital chaplain and my primary unit was the NICU so I have a deep connection and affection for families of premature babies. Having recently learned a new cast-on method, I decided to write this pattern for a top down preemie hat. 

Grab your yarn and needles. Happy Knitting!

~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~❧~

This hat is knit using the magic loop method (although the purchaser could easily adapt it for two circulars or double points).

The Emily Ocker Cast-On and Jeny’s Surprisingly Stretchy Bind-Off are used in this pattern.

The knitter needs to be comfortable with the following techniques: knit, purl, KFB, & k2tog. In addition, [a video tutorial for the Emily Ocker Cast-On has been recorded by the designer][2].

This pattern includes written instructions for the following sizes:
8.75 inch (22cm) will fit an average 24 week baby
9.5 inch (24cm) will fit an average 26 week baby
10.25 inch (26cm) will fit an average 28 week baby
11.5 inch (29cm) will fit an average 31 week baby
12.5 inch (32cm) will fit an average 35 week baby
13.5 inch (34.5cm) will fit an average 38 week baby
14.5 inch (37cm) will fit an average full-term baby

The pattern may look intimidating, but it’s simple to work and easy to memorize. It has beautiful drape and is breathable, but still cozy, making it the perfect piece to wear as winter slowly transitions to spring. For the complete set, make sure to check out the matching [Chouette Cowl][2] pattern in my Ravelry shop!

I went stash diving for this project and ended up using Our Back 40 alpaca yarn in a beautiful chestnut brown color. The listed weight is worsted, but it’s on the lighter side, so I recommend using DK instead. However, the weight difference between DK and worsted is slight, so feel free to use worsted if that’s what you have on hand! 


***MATERIALS***

Approximately 140 yards (128 m) of a DK (3) or worsted (4) weight yarn.

US size 4 (3.5mm) 16” circular knitting needles, or size needed to obtain gauge.

US size 4 (3.5mm) double-pointed needles (optional).

Common notions, such as stitch markers, measuring tape, yarn needle, and scissors.


***MEASUREMENTS***

Approximately 7.5” tall and 14” around. It is knit with negative ease, so it stretches to fit the head.

This hat tries to convey the sense of wonder nature brings and how fragile it is.  We often don’t see the beauty right in front of us.   Our lives are surrounded by ocean and sky that we often never see more than the surface of.  This little bear is awed by the stars in the sky.   Let’s all take a minute and look up tonight and see why….
Knit in Malabrigo Rios with their new solids line in mind  (yay!), in five sizes.  Both moon and star motifs are included as the point in the sky the bear is gazing at.   This hat will change completely if the bear is knit in brown or black, changing from a polar bear to a forest bear!  The field of stars is charted out, but if you miss a star or fleck or add one, just go with it.  As long as the snow and stars are randomly placed, the finished product will look fine.  Be your own designer, don’t get bogged down in the placement!  

A moon is included that can be used in the sky instead of a star if desired.

Lobelia Sackville-Baggins is not a hobbit to be messed with. Although Bilbo and Frodo aren’t on the best of terms with this no-nonsense relation, one thing they can’t deny about her is that she has class. Just like it’s namesake, this hat gets the job done and does it with style. The simple, stockinette folded brim gives way to an easy-to-memorize lace pattern that is beautiful without being too open. The invisible crown decreases make for a picture perfect top that only adds to the classiness. Wear this out, and you’ll be ready to handle anything.

**Clyde Hat**
Meet Clyde, the rebel sibling to our classic Forth Hat pattern! Perfect for using up scraps, this top-down pattern will have you casting on instantly.

The Clyde is the latest addition to our growing swatchless hat family, alongside Forth, Porty and viral bestseller Musselburgh. If you have been searching for a hat to truly make your own then look no further - the Clyde is perfect for getting into marls and experimenting with colourplay. A lover of scraps, it's the ideal design for using some of that handspun yarn that you have been saving. With a twist on the classic beanie, it features reverse stockinette knit inside out - which means that you can save yourself lots of purling!

If you have raced through several Musselburgh's or are looking for a fun, new project to cast on, the Clyde Hat is for you. The pattern comes in 6 sizes and 11 gauges, meaning that whether you are knitting for yourself or as a gift, the Clyde hat fits all.

As with our other patterns in this range, the swatchless design begins at the centre top: the crown is shaped by increasing outward in 4 ‘compass point’ lines. When you’ve created enough fabric to do so you can simply measure your gauge on the project, and match it to the numbers given for your size and gauge. Once the fun crown shaping is complete, there’s lots of soothing knitting that makes for the perfect “take anywhere” project. Choose from a deep folded brim, or a simple ribbed band – directions are included for both 1x1 and 2x2 rib.

**Yarn**
Fingering to bulky weight yarn. 

Exact yardage will depend on size, gauge and yarn used. 100–120g of yarn is enough for any size, gauge and yarn combination. For DK-chunky weights you may need extra yarn to add a pom pom to the adult large size.

This hat pattern is ideal for those beginner knitters that want to try cables. The simplicity of the cables and the quantity of them throughout the hat, makes it a perfect opportunity to practice this technique. 

The construction of this beanie is bottom up, multiple of 7. You will start by casting on the number of stitches needed for the size selected and knitting an elastic rib. Then you will proceed to the body of the pattern and the cable knitting. The end product is a tall beanie, slightly slouchy. The crown, due to the decreases, will look good without a pompom. However it will look absolutely stunning with it.

The pattern is written is US standard terms and includes child and adult sizes. It is recommended for advanced beginner knitters.

Bulky weight yarn (5) like Malabrigo Chunky, DHG Piuma, Cascade 128, Patons Rumor or any other yarn that meets gauge.

A perfect pattern for variegated and mottled yarns, the moss stitch creates beautiful texture without distracting from the subtleties of hand-dyed yarn. Increases and decreases are worked in pattern for a seamless aesthetic and reversible comfort.  

**Sizing**: The extra small will fit most children (age 4 and up) and the large will fit an adult male (hat size extra large). 
Extra-Small (Small, Medium, Large) 
Extra-Small will comfortably fit 20 - 22 in (51 - 56 cm) 
Small will comfortably fit 21 - 23 in (53 - 58 cm)
Medium will comfortably fit 22 - 24 in (56 - 61 cm)
Large will comfortably fit 23 - 25 in (58 - 63 cm)
*Each size will fit a range of head sizes, consider if you want loose and slouchy or more fitted when choosing a size.* 

**A Note on Slouch**: The pattern was written to be loose and slouchy, if you want more of a beanie fit consider knitting a smaller size and starting decreases earlier. For notes on the less slouchy version see project [Whitman in Grey Gardens][2], for notes on more slouchy see [Whitman Prototype][3]. You can also adjust the length of the ribbing, if you like a snug hat consider longer ribbing. If you really don't want any slouch you can omit the increases, but be prepared to consider that when you get to the decreases. Depending on head size, **decreases can start anytime after 6.5"" from ribbing**

**Yardage**: 160 (170, 180, 190) yards / 145 (155, 165, 175) meters.

**A note on gauge:** Please consider swatching with a US 7 if you are a tight knitter. You will need two needle sizes. The recommended sizes are either: US 5 (3.75mm) and US 6 (4mm) **or** US 6 (4mm) and US 7 (4.5mm). 

**A note on yarn:** You can use virtually any DK weight yarn, however this design loves to be paired with a plied, superwash wool. Please keep in mind superwash will bloom.

This hat was inspired by the variety of beautiful agates that can be found in some of the pebbly coves here in downeast Maine. The textural pattern is made up of three colors, but you use only one color at a time with slip and purl stitches. This forms a nice dense brim for extra warmth. The hardest part of this pattern? Deciding on which three colors to use! Great for stash busting!

This pattern is suitable for any knitter who can knit in the round on circular and double pointed needles. The hat is worked from the brim up. The slip stitch brim pattern is written out and is quite easy. The pattern is 2 pages long and has been professionally tech edited and fully test knit to be clear and free of errors.

**Sizes:**
Child (adult S/M, L/XL) Shown in size S/M.

254030,F*ck Cancer Hat,Kimberly Golynskiy,2.56,,,,,"UPDATE 07/30/2014: The pattern has been updated to include 4 sizes (baby through big headed adults), 3 yarn weights (fingering, sport, worsted), and charts for ""Fck Cancer,"" ""Fight Cancer,"" and ""Cancer Sucks"" for all sizes as well as ""Cancer Schmancer"" for sizes M & L in fingering and L in sport. 

If you are someone who cannot read charts and need the written instructions, PM me the size, yarn weight, and desired chart and I will send you the instructions. 

UPDATE 06/26/2014: I have to update this pattern. My 2.5 year old niece was just diagnosed with brain cancer and will be starting chemo in the next couple of weeks. I will be updating the pattern soon to include instructions for fingering weight and sport weight and a few variations of charts. For reals, FCK CANCER.

My dad was diagnosed with Stomach Cancer in July 2003. He was given 6 weeks to live, told to get his affairs in order, go home, and wait to die. He was 52 and this was unacceptable for him - he decided to fight. In June 2005, after nearly two years of chemo, radiation, pic lines, feeding tubes, and numerous hospital stays, he finally lost his battle. With every birthday, holiday, wedding, or birth of a grandchild he will never meet, all I can think is Fck Cancer. 

This hat is for anyone who is battling cancer, has lost someone to it, or is supporting someone in their fight. It's a perfect chemo hat or to wear during a cancer walk or run. 

This pattern is free - but I'd love if you would donate something to cancer research in place of payment. 

Notes:
Needles needed: Fingering: US5/3.75mm and US7/4.5mm 16”/40cm circular needles and DPNs, Sport: US6/4mm and US8/5mm 16”/40cm circular needles and DPNs, Worsted: US7/4.5mm and US9/5.5mm 16”/40cm circular needles and DPNs

Gauge: In 4” in stockinette in the round: Fingering – 24 sts x 26 rows, Sport – 20 sts x 24 rows, Worsted – 16 sts x 22 rows (on larger needle for weight). **Whatever yarn you use, just make sure when working the color sections, that your floats are not too tight or the fit will be tight and will pull the letters.**

Life moves in crazy ways.  Like ""a series of short sharp turns, angles, or alterations in a course,"" which is the definition of a zigzag.  The Find Your Way Beanie is designed with that in mind.  Your life can be going one way and then all of a sudden it takes a turn in another direction.  But no matter what, life is beautiful.  Celebrate the changes and remind yourself how lucky you are with this bulky knit beanie.

The Find Your Way Beanie is knit using the mosaic method of colorwork.  A perfect way to try your hand at 2 colors!  It uses slip stitches and alternating colors every two rows, so no need to worry about floats and tension!  It's a really cool way to knit colorwork!  Experiment with colors and have fun with it!

Choose from either a fitted or slouchy style!  And if using Malabrigo Mecha, 2 skeins = 2 hats!  After making the first, you will have enough to make it's ""opposite!!""

Fair Isle, also known as stranded colorwork knitting, is the perfect way to start experimenting with color and different pattern motifs. With a sport or DK weight yarn, solid color, tonal or gradient everyone can make colorful and warm winter garments.

The Olof hat is worked in the round from the bottom up, starting with two rows of 1x1 rib in contrasting color followed by two color 2x2 corrugated rib. The hat body uses 5 different, easy to remember Fair Isle motifs. They can be re-used in scarfs and mittens. The Olof hat is knitted in two colors. Would four colors work? Go ahead, try it.

The hat is very customizable.  As written the hat has 11 rows of brickwork and can easily be extended by repeating body of the pattern as many times as desired.  This can be a bit of a stash buster, so dig through your old balls of yarn to find the right color palate for your version of the Dupont Street Hat.

462079,Michele,Sarah Punderson,1.91,22.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,250.0,"2 versions of the same hat, one slightly slouchy and one very slouchy.

A simple slip stitch pattern is used for the body of this hat worked in the round; easy to memorize and great for variegated yarns. The very slouchy hat is fuller and longer.
Included in the pattern are photos, a complete list of abbreviations, and a stitch glossary.
Skill level: Advanced beginner.
Experience with working in the round helpful.
This hat is worked from the bottom up.

Any DK weight yarn can be used as long as you match gauge. Yarns of different fiber content and twist will give a slightly different look. Any variegated or handspun yarns would be fine. For an even slouchier version use a drapey yarn, one with some silk or bamboo, or a single ply yarn.
The slightly slouchy version uses about 200yds and the very slouchy version uses about 250yds. 

I also have a paid for pattern that features this design written for 7 different weights of yarn, [Lucky 7.][1]

575816,It's Not About the Hat,Susan Rainey,4.82,20.0,4.0,stranded stockinette stitch in the round,160.0,"This pattern is not about the hat, it’s about the technique!!  A fabulous technique (ladderback jacquard) that has been used in machine knitting that I call **Invisible Stranding**.  

Invisible Stranding allows you to carry yarn across any number of stitches without catching the floats.  Catching floats creates a visible pucker in your knitting and often allows the other color to show through.  Invisible Stranding eliminates both of these problems.  The Good Hat/Bad Hat photo shows the difference!

The Invisible Stranding technique is described in the pattern and demonstrated in a series of YouTube videos.  I put my own spin on the technique and share my tips and tricks with you.

The technique can be applied to other patterns, and the Invisible Stranding Guide (included with the pattern) describes how.  

In fact, I would be happy to help you determine if a particular pattern would benefit from this technique.  Just send me a message.


***Pattern Information***
**Sizes:** Extra Small XS (19”), Small S (20”), Medium M (21”), Large L (22”), Extra Large XL (23”)

**Two styles:** Standard fit and ‘slouchy’ fit.  Overall length of standard fit hat is 8-8 ½ inches.  Slouchy Style is 9 ½ - 10 inches, or more if you prefer.  

**Materials:** Worsted weight yarn in two contrasting colors.  High contrast will allow you to see how the technique works.

Shown in Malabrigo Worsted, Colors Natural #63 (MC) and Stone Blue #99 (CC) or Fuschia Color #93 (CC); 110 yards MC, 50 yards CC for size large, slouchy style; 90 yards MC, 45 yards CC for small standard style hat.  Yardage is approximate and will vary depending on your gauge and preferred hat style.  Generally it takes about twice as much of the background color.

**Gauge:** 20 sts and 28 rounds in stranded knitting on larger needle

NOTE: row gauge does matter here as the overall depth of the hat will be affected.  You may need to make minor adjustments to account for this.

**Needles:** Size 7 circular needles or size needed to achieve gauge; length depends on your preferred knitting technique (i.e., magic loop, etc.) for ~20 inches in the round;  
Size 6 circular needles (one size smaller than above), see note about length – this needle is used for the single color knitting at the top of the hat.  If your gauge does not change when you switch to single-color knitting, you may not need this additional size.
DPNs (for shaping at crown) in same size as used for single color knitting.

**Techniques Used:** Stranded knitting, knitting in the round, slipping sts, increasing/decreasing, other special techniques described in the pattern.  Previous experience with stranded knitting is highly recommended.",7.0,137,610,4.76,"XS (19 inch), S (20 inch), M (21 inch), L (22 inch), XL (23 inch)",Aran

728290,Pride Parade,Heather Walpole,1.44,18.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,140.0,"I grew up in a small town not really knowing any gay people or maybe I did but I didn't know it. When I got my first real job I made friends and I liked who I liked. I didn't know that my boss was gay and I really didn't care. She was great at her job and taught me a lot about design. After weeks on the job I asked a passing question about her ""husband"" and all of my coworkers had a good belly-laugh at my expense.

That moment was a pivotal learning experience in my life about how I live and love. I learned that I really, deep-down, don't care if you live your life differently than I do; if I like you, I like you and that's that. Everyone is different and they are taking a path through life just like I am. I want everyone to have the same opportunities to enjoy each day and that's why I designed this hat. We are all equal. It's that simple. So this is a simple hat with stripes. I sized it from baby to adult so you can make one for anyone and everyone you love.

**Note:** Yarn amounts are based on the weight of Ewe Ewe [Wooly Worsted yarn][2] and may vary with other yarns. Amount shown is to create the largest size hat.

**Needles:** US 8 (5 mm) 16"" circular knitting needles; US 8 (5 mm) double-pointed knitting needles.

**Inspiration**

The Tree Boughs & Trails Hat is a modern take on traditional German twisted-stitch patterns. An unusual leaf stitch pattern hints at branches of trees; a clever cable variation suggests trails that meander through the woods. This hat uses a cozy merino—sourced and spun in America—to make all those twisted stitches and cables pop.

1037895,Everyday Lined Hat,Denise Bayron,2.68,20.0,4.0,Stockinette Stitch ,190.0,"We’re living in historic and difficult times. During a global pandemic and subsequent quarantine, getting a haircut is a challenge. No worries, I'm here to help keep you safe and stylish! You can make a hat that will cover your #quarantinehair and fit seamlessly into your wardrobe. 

For ages, women with textured hair have covered their tresses with silk and satin scarves to prevent frizz. Adding a silky lining to a knitted hat is a stylish and modern interpretation of that hair-saving trick, and it is convenient for all genders! If you're a sporty/outdoorsy person, you might appreciate a moisture-wicking lining. If you’re living in a cold climate, you may want to line yours with fleece. Or maybe you have sensitive skin and wool hats make your forehead itch. Alternatively, a lined hat is a thoughtful gift for someone suffering from alopecia or undergoing cancer treatment. There are endless reasons to line a hat! 

I hope you enjoy this beginner-friendly pattern and learn a few things in the process. I’m so excited to share this project with you!

**Construction:** 

**This hat is both a knitting AND sewing pattern.** My intention is to use this pattern as a teaching tool to help knitters learn how to sew - and vice versa! The construction will serve as a learning tool for those who would like to learn top-down raglan sweater knitting. If you can knit this hat, you can make any of my raglan sweater designs!

You will learn how to:

* knit a top-down  hat
* work magic loop
* work the easiest tubular bind off - a sewn bind off
* sew stretch fabrics
* machine sew a beanie lining 
* hand sew the lining into a knitted hat

**Sizes:** 

Small (Medium, Large)
to fit head circumferences of 19.5 (21, 23) inches / 49.5 (53, 58.5) cm. 
Shown in size L with an intended 2” / 5 cm of negative ease. 
If you are between sizes, it is recommended that you choose one size down.

**Recommended Yarn:** 

Ritual Dyes, Elder, 100 g = 190 yards / 174 m per skein. One skein will suffice for all sizes including a 4 x 4” / 10 x 10 cm swatch. Colorways shown are Forsythia, Smoke, and Chromite.

**Alternative Yarns:** 

Light Worsted to DK weight yarns

**Fabric:** 

1/4 yards of knit (not woven) four-way stretch fabric. 
For example: Silk jersey, regular jersey, moisture-wicking jersey for those who enjoy sports, or fleece for warmth.

**Needles:** 

* US 5 / 3.75 mm as the main needle on 32” / 81 cm cable for magic loop or needle size needed to achieve gauge. 
* US 4 / 3.5 mm for ribbing. Choose a 32” / 81cm cable for magic loop OR 16” / 40cm cable for working in the round. Go down one needle size from the main needle to work the ribbing.
* Optional: US 5 / 3.75 mm circular needles on a 16” / 40cm cable.

**Notions:** 

KNITTING  PATTERN

**Pattern #48 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**

by Nancy Bates


One of the last great migrations on earth happens twice a year across the vast tundra, sand dunes, and rivers of Kobuk Valley.   Every spring and fall, nearly a quarter million caribou make the 600 mile trek between their northern and southern grounds, just as they have for 9000 years – criss-crossing the dunes and swimming across the Kobuk River.   With just the right colors and the magic of knitting, you can recreate this amazing scene from the bottom up. A couple dozen caribou will migrate across your hat in the spring and then back the other direction in the fall, swimming in the Kobuk River as they go with the sand dunes looming in the distance.

It’s knit with a rustic wool to protect your head from harsh weather. Express yourself by choosing fun colors that represent you!

This pattern was created for the Neuronknit Series, about #concussionrecovery and other #traumaticbraininjury awareness and support.

I want to rise awareness of mirror neurons in our brain and the importance of engaging them after a brain injury, also while acknowledging the importance of family and friends support.

154288,Shroom,Lee Juvan,2.03,10.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,120.0,"Instant gratification should not be underrated, especially in the winter. As soon as I laid my hands on a skein of Spud & Chloe Outer, I was a goner. Ultra soft, dense, and comforting—this is a hot-chocolate-on-a-cold night kind of yarn, and I wanted to be wearing something made from it right away. Lucky for me, the yarn knits up so quickly that I was, in fact, wearing something from it within hours of squeezing my first skein.

Shroom knits up lightening fast at two and a half stitches per inch and will be hugging your head—or the head of a lucky recipient—sooner than you can forage for a basketful of Boletus edulis. And wouldn’t you rather head to your LYS instead of the mall for your last-minute shopping? I thought so.

Please note that you may need to use a larger needle than the one I used--I am a loose knitter. It's the gauge you need to match; not the needle size. Otherwise, your hat may be too tight and the slouchy part won't drape nicely. I know plenty of knitters who needed to make this hat on 13s and even 15s to match the gauge!

Because I've had a lot of questions related to this, I feel that I need to add that this pattern and the knitted design to which it refers are subject to copyright: You may not sell or distribute paper or electronic copies of the pattern or sell finished Shrooms. Thank you for understanding!

Thanks to fellow Raveler Caroline Pannetier (carolineuh on Rav), there's a French translation of Shroom available on her [blog][1].

1280730,Cozy Pumpkin Hat,Ksenia Naidyon,2.2,19.0,4.0,4x1 Rib,515.0,"Nothing makes a fall outfit quite as season-appropriate as a nice pumpkin hat :) Cute and fun but also warm and comfortable, this piece is ready to become a favorite autumn accessory!

Chunky gauge makes Cozy Pumpkin Hat a fast knit and wide ribbing adds just a proper amount of stretch. The pattern is graded to fit a variety of sizes from newborn to adult, and can be worked using yarns of different weights. Make it in another color or add a pompom instead of a stem to create a seasonless piece!

The curly vine can be either crocheted with a crochet hook (as on the sample hat) or knit in an i-cord manner. Directions for both techniques are provided.

This pattern is offered for free. If you feel like saying “thank you” to the designer and have the means, consider buying me [a coffee here][1].

- Suggested fit: newborn (baby, toddler, child) (teen, adult small, medium, large)
- All bodies are different, so it's best to pick the size based on the head circumference minus 1-2"" / 2.5-5cm for a semi-snug fit or minus 2-4"" / 5-10cm for a snug fit
- Shown in size B on a 6 months old baby with 1"" / 2.5cm of negative ease

**Yarn**

Use almost any yarn weight you wish as long as you can get the recommended gauge and are happy with the resulting fabric. Yardage below is a rough estimate.

- Heavy Worsted / Aran - in 1 strand, 85 (115, 150, 170) (190, 210, 235, 260)yds / 80 (105, 135, 155) (175, 190, 215, 240)m total

- Sample hat yarn: Schaefer Yarn Company Nicole (80% sw merino, 20% nylon, 5 oz / 142g, 405 yds / 370 m), sport weight held in 2 strands, color Saffron

**Needles and Gauge**

- Swatch to determine needle size that helps to fit the gauge of 19 sts and 30 rows in 4"" / 10cm in 4x1 Rib, blocked; needle size below is a suggestion
- US 8 / 5mm circular needles on a 16"" / 40cm cable, OR on a long cable for the magic loop method, OR a set of dpns
- A set of dpns might be handy for working the top of the hat and the stem

**Construction**

- The hat is knit from the bottom up seamlessly in the round with the folded hem.
- The hem can be secured to the body of the hat so that it doesn't unfold; directions for this are provided.
- Once the desired length of the hat is reached, the crown is shaped with several rounds of decreases. 
- The stem is attached to the crown seamlessly. It is worked in the round using the magic loop technique or a set of dpns.
- The curly vine can be either crocheted with a crochet hook (as on the sample hat) or knit in an i-cord manner. Directions for both techniques are provided.

Some recent additions were a selection of trilobites in shale, collected last March in Oak Springs Summit, Nevada. Examining these, it occurred to me that the form of the trilobite in relief might make for a challenging cable project.

The resulting hat is worked from the brim up, and four cabled trilobite sections are worked vertically. The crown decreases follow the visual line created by the narrowing trilobite body, and hence won’t interfere with the pattern.

This quick and engaging project will make a great holiday gift for all your paleontologically-inclined loved ones.

<big>**Please note** This hat pattern is available both as a stand alone pattern (which includes both versions of the hat but no embroidery) or as part of the [Penchant Expansion Pack ebook][1] (which includes both versions of the hat, a lengthy primer on duplicate stitch, and specific instructions for six different ways to embroider on these hats). </big>

<hr>

Exploring variations on a theme is my happy place. I love to find something fun, then tweak it and tweak it and tweak it, just to see what happens.

For these hats, that meant starting with a pretty little ribbing then setting to work with increases and decreases to make that ribbing wander off in a rather fetching fashion. But you see, there’s more than one way to do that. And it was too hard to pick just one, so I ended up doing two. Because once you realize you can get two different versions of a hat, each delightful and each with a different vibe, just by changing how you stack up your increases and decreases? Well it’s hard not to go ahead and do exactly that. 

Restraint was never my strong suit!

And speaking of my scandalous lack of restraint, these hats are especially well suited to further adornment. When I was done knitting, I used duplicate stitch to doodle all over mine (you’ll see that in some of the pictures). If you happen to find yourself wanting to do the same, check out the [Penchant Expansion Pack ebook][3], which includes this hat pattern, explores duplicate stitch in general, and covers six options for adorning these hats in particular.

<hr>

**General information**

This 20-page pattern includes information for both hats.


**Skills & scope**

The actual knitting is surprisingly simple. You'll start the brim with a simple little rib, then set to work making that rib wrap round the sides of the hat, then finish everything off with some of the loveliest decreases I ever did see.


I embroidered on mine after I was done (you can see that in several of the pictures). ***Just to be super clear, this pattern covers the hats, not the embroidery. If you want the embroidery instructions too, you want the [Penchant Expansion Pack ebook][4], which includes the hat pattern and a lengthy primer on duplicate stitch and specific instructions for embroidering on the hats!***


The pattern uses [charts][5], so you will need to know how to follow a knitting chart.

**Yarn, gauge & sizing**

The hat comes in four sizes (from a 72 stitch cast on to a 120 stitch cast on) and is written for five gauges (from three and a half to six stitches per inch in half stitch increments). That means you can use just about any weight of yarn from fingering up through worsted, and there will be a size to fit pretty much anyone's head. Basically anything that will give you a fabric with a drape you like somewhere in that range of gauges will work.

The hat in the pictures took about 175 yards of sport-weight yarn. If you're working with thinner yarn, 250 yards is a safer bet.

**Tools & supplies**

You’ll need needles that let you work in the round (circulars or DPNs) in whatever size lets you get a solid fabric with your chosen yarn plus the general knitting tools you need for most projects (scissors to cut your yarn, a darning needle to weave in ends, the occasional stitch marker or bit of scrap yarn to hold stitches).

**Note**

If you already have the hat, and now find you want the expansion pack ebook, I’ve got everything set up so ***whatever you already spent on the hat pattern will count towards the cost of the expansion pack***. You don’t need to do anything to make that happen, it’ll just work (just be sure you’re logged into whatever ravelry account you were using when you bought the hat).

843387,Storyteller Hat,Lindsey Faciane,2.69,20.0,4.0,mock honeycomb stitch,180.0,"My journey as a maker has been full of twists and turns, ups and downs, wins and losses, smiles and tears. One thing that has stayed consistent over the years though, is that this endeavor is mine. Lately I’ve been seeing more and more creatives try to squeeze themselves into a mold for the sake of getting noticed, and it always makes me a little sad. I believe that knitting is a special and beautiful art form, and that true art is always a reflection of the artist in one way or another. This design, the Storyteller Hat, is a celebration of all of us makers, because we each have a unique perspective to pour into our art and into our world. Everything you create tells a story, so make it **your** story.


This design features a beautiful, unique texture that looks much more complicated than it is and an unparalleled squish factor! It has a slightly slouchy fit that looks good on men and women alike and is great to wear for a casual lunch date, a hiking trip into the snowy mountains, or an exciting night out on the town! I like to top the Storyteller Hats I make with a faux fur pom pom, but this beanie looks great without them too, if that’s more your style. With the help of my photo tutorials, an advanced beginner should be able to complete this project with ease.


**MATERIALS**

* Approx. 170 yards of DK or worsted weight yarn. I used [Darn Good Yarn’s Worsted Weight Merino Wool in the colorway “Yummy,”][1] and I highly recommend it!! Kits to make this beanie will be available from Darn Good Yarn very soon. :)

* US size 8 (5mm) 16” circular knitting
  needles

* US size 8 (5mm) DPNs (optional)
  
* Stitch marker (optional)
  
* Yarn Needle
  
* Scissors


**MEASUREMENTS**

Measures approx. 19” around at the brim x 8.75” tall.


**GAUGE**

20 st x 40 rounds = 4” in mock honeycomb stitch.

Sometimes a pattern comes to my mind fully formed. That was the case with this easy colorwork hat. I wanted to use leftovers from previous projects, and I wanted to see large standing stone structures, such as Stonehenge, dancing around my hat. I got so excited about the various possible color combinations that I want to million of them! And since this hat comes in eight sizes, you can knit tons of them, too.

994253,Whidbey Island Beanie,Fairlight Fibers,2.0,18.0,4.0,Ribbing,140.0,"Sometimes the best things in life are astonishingly simple. This easy hat is about as basic as they come: just 1x1rib with a neat row of knit stitches to decorate the edge of the folded rim. Simple decreases are spaced to keep the hat from rising up or being too pointy. It's basic, beautiful, and squishy-warm! Perfect for gifts, quick knits, and soon to be your favorite staple.

The Whidbey Island Beanie is knit in the round from 60-70 grams of worsted or light aran-weight yarn and can be made from a variety of fibers. Shown here: 

West Yorkshire Spinners The Croft in Clousta (Jess's cover hat) or Mossbank (Joe's hat)

Stonehedge Fiber Mill Shepherd's Wool Worsted in Sage (Shelli's hat)

Subculture Yarn SW Merino Worsted in Blue Camas (Jess's second hat) and January 2020's Pre-Order Yarn Club exclusive colorway!

The hat is knit in one size, which will stretch to fit a head from 15"" to... well, bigger than any head we measured. Jess wears a 22"" hat, Joe and Shelli are wearing theirs at 24"", but it's all the same hat! Joe's hat features a slightly longer brim, which works nicely for those with larger hat sizes.",,69,58,4.55,one size,Aran

“A bit of striping, a bit of ribbing—a bunch of cozy!”
In this pattern, we blend the sportiness of stripes with the snug squish of ribbing to create a cozy, classic beanie! Our design uses a clever little trick to smooth up the stripes within the ribbing texture—an all-knit row (instead of the K2/P2 ribbing) as you change colors crisps up that definition! We also provide instructions for three different sizes, so you can make stripey hats for your whole family!

We knit a version of the Striped Ribbed Beanie in DK-weight Lore from The Fibre Co. and another in worsted-weight Blue Sky Fibers Woolstok.

This two-page pattern includes:
- Color photography by Laura Gehring
- Tips on adjusting the height of the hat for more or less slouch
- Instructions for finishing and blocking your piece

*""The gentle banded textures of Grist bring a modern take to traditional gansey textures from classic fisherman sweaters. The gentle knit-purl patterns adorning the hat body are both soft and defined in Imbue Sport, a three ply merino wool with a balance of definition and loft. The hat is worked with a squishy doubled brim that is worked to twice the target length, then folded over and sandwiched together, creating a polished, professional finish with added cushioning and warmth around the ears. The simple texture patterns — pairing simple knit and purl stitches in various combinations — are easy to remember and soothing to work.""* — designer, Jared Flood

*Please note: the stitch patterns used for this accessory include written as well as charted instructions.*

----------------------------------------

**Construction**

* The hat is worked circularly from the bottom up, beginning with a doubled brim worked in 1x1 ribbing. Stitches for the hat are cast on provisionally and 1x1 ribbing is worked to twice the finished length of the brim. The brim is then folded in half and joined, with one round of live stitches being worked together with the provisionally cast-on stitches.
* The body of the hat is then worked in the Grist stitch pattern, which may be worked from either charted or written instructions.
* After completion of the hat body, crown shaping is worked in concentric rings to close the top of the hat.

**Finished Dimensions**

* 18½”/47 cm circumference, unstretched
* 8¼”/21 cm finished length (or 8¾”/22 cm for lengthened brim mod)
* To fit head sizes: 20-23”/51-58.5 cm (with optional modification to fit head sizes 23-25”/58.5-63.5 cm)

7340333,Heartleaf Birch Hat,Sarah Rody,3.25,20.0,4.0,stockinette,210.0,"I designed this hat because I accidentally cast on the wrong number of stitches while trying to knit a different pattern and didn’t want to rip out all my ribbing. 

Materials
Yarn: about 180-210 yds (165-210 m) of worsted weight yarn. I used Malabrigo Rios and Washted. These are lighter worsted weights (210 yds/200 m per 100 g). If your yarn is heavier, you might run short of yarn. If you are worried about running out of yarn, you can opt for a single brim. 

Needles: Size US 6 (4 mm) needles, or whatever size is needed to make gauge, 16-inch circulars, and double pointed needles (or your preferred method of medium- and small-circumference knitting in the round). 

Size US 4 (3.5 mm) needles, or 1-2 sizes smaller than your main needles, 16-inch circulars for knitting the brim ribbing. 

Gauge
About 20 stitches and 27 rows in 4 inches by 4 inches (10 cm by 10 cm) of stockinette stitch, using the larger needles. 

Sizing
This hat fits my 22-inch (56 cm) head. Due to the stretch of the cables and ribbing stitch, I think it would fit about 20-24 inches (51-61 cm). To adjust the lenth, you could change the gauge, change the length the ribbing, or add or subtract a pattern repeat. My finished hat is about 11 inches deep, unfolded. I like long hats! Many testers preferred to omit a repeat. 

Thank you to all of my testers!

This fun hat knits up quickly.  The pattern uses slipped stitches to form the trellis pattern, which I've always thought is a sneaky way to look fancy without actually being complicated to knit.  Mostly it's knit and purl.  

The button band is worked right along with the rest of the hat - no seaming and no picking up stitches. It allows you to wear your ponytail high, low, or in between - just undo the button that corresponds to the position of your ponytail.   Or wear it with a messy bun by undoing two buttons instead of one.  

Instructions are written out row by row; you don't need to be able to read a chart to knit this hat.    

You might start making this as a gift, but you will want to keep it for yourself!

>   Prefer a beanie version?  See the
> Trellis Beanie [here][1].

**Yarn**:  Approximately 60 grams/125 -150 yards/120 - 145 meters worsted weight yarn. The stitch pattern means lets you use a solid or tonal to great effect, but variegated and speckled yarns also work well.  There are lots of examples on the [project page.][2] 

**Needles:**  US #7 (4.5 mm) or size needed to achieve gauge plus one size smaller. This hat is worked flat.

1. This hat is cast on at the brim. Decreases are made towards the top and the final stitches are cinched together with remaining yarn.
2. Place a marker to help you recognize the beginning of a new row. Slip the marker as you come to it. 
3. Knit more rows of the main body to make the hat slouchier!
4. Knitting the size small gave me plenty of yarn to make a pom. Please note that knitting larger sizes may require additional yarn for the pom pom.

1169247,All Together Now Hat,Jamie Lomax,2.18,24.0,4.0,colorwork,275.0,"This hat is a tribute to the amazing indie dyers that I was able to work with during my first year designing knitting patterns. The phrase **All Together Now** references the Beatles song by the same name, inspired by the music hall tradition of asking the audience to join in, prompting knitters to join in sharing in the fiber community.

The **All Together Now Hat** is a stranded colorwork design for a beanie hat. This pattern is knit in the round using circular needles, from the bottom up.

Instructions are **written for Fingering, DK, and Worsted weight yarn**. Be sure to review the information for the chosen weight yarn for appropriate yardage and follow the specific instructions for that weight in order to ensure correct cast on stitch count and decrease location.

Instructions are written to **knit a single or double (folded) brim**. Both versions use twisted ribbing, however, the folded version is knit twice as long, before folding back on itself and grafting together for a cozy thick brim.

It is the perfect project to use single skeins, mini skeins or project scraps in heavy DK or light worsted weight yarn. Superwash wool or wool blend recommended. Solid colors and subtle tonal yarns make for a high contrast design, while variegated and speckled yarns create a dynamic and almost kinetic visual effect. 

Two brim options: A stretchy, folded brim creates a modern Watch Cap look perfect for adding decorative patches. A standard stretchy brim design looks great with or without a pom pom as a classic winter hat. 

Three colorwork designs for the main hat allow knitters to choose from three-, four- or five-color palettes. Charted instructions are also written out in full. Three unique crown designs are available for all sizes, offering many possibilities from one pattern. Make your hat unique or create a whole set of hats for friends or family from just one pattern!

Knitters building their colorwork skills will have an opportunity to practice three-color stranding for a few rounds in a rhythmic and easily memorized sequence, and the entire hat can be made without catching floats. 

This pattern has been professionally tech edited. It offers additional tips about choosing a brim style and optimizing the colorwork motif around the jog as well as accommodating alternate gauges. 

Yardage Requirements: 90-275 yards (80-250 meters) total for hat, including all contrast colors. Baby: 90-150 yards (80-140 meters); Small: 150-220 yards (140-200 meters); Medium: 170-250 yards (155-230 meters); Large: 190-275 yards (175-250 meters). Allow for at least 100-120 yards (95-110 meters) of main/brim color if working a folded brim in any size and as much as 190 yards (175 meters) if working a folded brim in a three-color, size Large.

**Tyrie**
Named after the beautiful shores of the Kingdom of Fife, the Tyrie Hat will have you magically transported to the sights and sounds of the sea in no time. Featured in our Stranded Colourwork Basics course, Tyrie is an ideal place to start learning colourplay.

This is a fun project that wants you to explore the joys of colour! We designed the pattern to be perfect for mix and matching yarn — so that you can make 2 or even 3 coordinating hats from the same kit. Or if you are feeling really adventurous, why not try using up some scraps for a truly unique result? We knit up our sample using Stranded Dyeworks BFL DK, who have created the dreamiest Spring and Autumn palettes in kit form for this hat.

Tyrie is worked from the bottom up and features a simple 4 stitch repeat — meaning you have no long floats to deal with. This pattern is great for beginners as it is easy to keep track of whilst you work. You'll start by making a deep rib, before easing into the colourwork for the central part of the beanie. The pattern ends with a softly gathered crown shaping that requires no colourwork. Tyrie Hat comes in 3 sizes and will have you swiftly adding skills to your toolbox and gifts to your family and friends.

*Please note: the stitch patterns used for this accessory include written as well as charted instructions.*

----------------------------------------

**Construction

* The hat is worked circularly from the bottom up,with one of two brim options worked in 1x1 ribbing.
* Option 1: a doubled brim: stitches for the hat are cast on provisionally and 1x1 ribbing is worked to twice the finished depth of the brim. The brim is then folded in half and joined, with one round of live stitches being worked together with the provisionally cast-on stitches.
* Option 2: a standard, single brim: stitches for the hat are cast on and 1x1 ribbing is worked to the desired length.
* After completion of the ribbed brim, the body of the hat is worked in the Weft stitch pattern, creating a woven basketweave texture.
* Upon completion of the unshaped portion of the hat body, crown shaping is worked to close the top of the hat. The decreases have been designed to integrate invisibly into the crown, maintaining a woven look throughout the entire project.

This design was a joy to knit. After Malabrigo contacted me asking if I’d like to try their new Mohair Lace yarn, I then had to figure out what to make with it. 

I paired a coordinating Malabrigo Sock yarn and cast on. I hope you enjoy making the Evergreen Hat. Who are we kidding, I know you will. 

Tag me on Instagram with #evergreenhat.

 I’m so excited to see what colors you choose. 

The Evergreen Hat is named after a small town in Colorado. Evergreen is known for the beautiful scenery, peacefulness, and being one of the best places to call home in Colorado. 

Wait… Did someone say MOHAIR? This stunningly simple, slouchy, no-frills hat will keep you busy for the weekend. You’ll get a ton of compliments when you wear it. Evergreen Hat was designed to accommodate a wide range of sock yarns and lace mohair.

The Beautifully Basic Hat evolved from a need for an easy project that could use any single skein of yarn in any weight. Upstate New York is full of fiber festivals, and it’s common to come home with unique skeins of handspun or hand-dyed yarn that can never be found again. This straightforward pattern lets you choose a size, find your gauge, and cast right on. Knit it as-is, or be adventurous and add in a textured or lace panel. Think of this pattern as a basic recipe to which you can add your own flair. The possibilities are endless!

Choose a needle size that gives you the fabric you want - smaller needles will give you a denser, tighter fabric, while larger needles will give you a looser, drapier fabric.

issue two : new york state is a collection of knitwear designs inspired by the wonderful things Upstate New York has to offer: apples, farmland, rivers and lakes galore, and unmatched foliage every autumn. Knitting patterns for ten new beautiful sweaters, shawls, hats, and mitts are featured in indie dyed yarn from a dozen yarn makers and dyers throughout the region. Mull some cider - recipe included! - and cozy up to the fireplace as you turn the pages and imagine yourself picking apples in the clean, crisp fall air.

**Sizing:**  Finished circumference: 12 (14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24)”/ 30 (35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60)cm.
The standard recommendation is to choose a size that will give you 1-2”/2.5-5cm of negative ease, so the hat fits snugly. For example, if your head is 22”/55 cm around, you should knit a size 20”/50cm.  However, if you want a looser fit, perhaps to protect your hairstyle from flattening on your way to work, knit your actual size.  The sizes included in the pattern are typical of preemie (newborn, baby, toddler, child/teenager, adult, large adult). 

**Needles:** A 16”/40cm circular works for most sizes, along with a set of DPN's to close the top.  (The 2 smallest hat sizes will need a 12”/30cm circular instead, or DPNs or a long circular for magic loop.) The ribbing should be worked with a needle one size smaller than the gauge needles.

**Gauge:** varies between 8 and 36 stitches = 4”/10cm in Stockinette stitch, depending on yarn weight.

**Notions:** 1 stitch marker, tapestry needle.

**Samples knit in:** Handmade Travels Tassie Fingering (100% Merino; 516 yards/472 meters per 100g); Jill Draper Makes Stuff Mohonk (100% unregistered NYS Cormo Wool; 370 yards/338 meters per 113g) colorway Vermillion (held double in sample); Knitting Garage Donegal DK (85% superwash Merino, 15% bigs of color; 231 yards/211 meters per 100g); 7th Floor Yarn Tweed Aran (85% superwash Merino, 15% Nylon; 183 yards/167 meters per 100g) colorway Salted Caramel; Hudson Valley Sheep & Wool Company Josephine (100% Merino; 160 yards/146 meters per 100g) colorway Spruce; Loopy Mango Merino No. 5 (100% Merino; 74 yards/68 meters per 150g) colorway Bordeaux; DebDotyKnits Corespun 1-ply (varied materials; approx. 100 yds per 200g).

You can achieve several different looks based on color choices and reversibility. Fits any head size, from 15""-24"". The worsted weight yarn makes it a super quick project for holiday gifts, but go ahead and be selfish -- knit one for yourself, too. 

This might be a good project for those who want to try brioche but don't know where to start. There are just a couple of stitches to learn, no complicated increases or decreases, and you get to take a break with plain ribbing every few rows. One of my test knitters who had never tried brioche before was able to complete the hat in about a week.

A total of 180-ish yards of worsted weight yarn will be plenty for any size.

To all my fellow knitterinos who attended My Favorite Weekend, I hope you had fun in Santa Barbara!

It is knitted in the round from the bottom up. 
A beginner level knitter should do fine with this pattern.

Instructions are given for head sizes 18” (46 cm), 21” (53 cm), 22” (56 cm) and 23” (58 cm). These correspond to child, small, medium and large adult sizes.

The beanie is knitted with sport weight or light DK yarn. You may use any sport or light DK weight yarn, but the yarn used in the hat pictured is Dream in Color Cosette.

Amount of yarn needed: (100, 125, 150, 175) yds / (90, 114, 136, 160) m 

Gauge: 22 sts and 28 rows/4” (10 cm) in unblocked stockinette.

7287158,My Favorite Slouchy,Shelby Mooney,1.67,17.0,4.0,knit in the round with size US 10 needles,160.0,"Whenever I visit yarn stores or fiber events I am always in awe of the many indie dyers out there who make the most GORGEOUS, squishy yarn in the most fabulous colorways. 

Though I never have a project in mind, I usually try to buy a few worsted or DK skeins in the colors I like knowing I can always make this hat. It’s one of my favorite hats to make, wear, and gift. It’s also perfect for donating. I like using cozy, luxury yarn in my charity knitting because IMHO people in need deserve the most beautiful things to help lift their spirits and give them hope.

Sometimes I make it slouchier, sometimes I add more rows to the ribbing, sometimes I add less decrease rounds for a poufy crown. Any way you like it, it’s the perfect quick project, it’s super easy to wear, and it’s a fantastic way to use all of the yummy yarn from those indie dyers!

This hat is knit in the round with the smaller size needles for the ribbing and the larger size for the body.

Needles: US 7 (4.5 mm) and US 10 (6 mm) 16” circulars or interchangeable needles (or longer for magic loop method). DPNs may be used for the decreases if you prefer. If you are a tight knitter or if you prefer a larger hat, or if your yarn is a bit thicker, you can always go up to size US 10.5 (6.5 mm) or 11 (8 mm) for the body.

Approximate yardage: 140-160 yards of any Worsted, or Aran weight. I used an indie, hand dyed, DK worsted yarn held together with one strand of mohair for the ultimate coziness.

**Can I sell the hat I made using this pattern?**
(Copy and pasted from blog)
Just as a general reply, I've been getting way more 'can I sell this item?' messages, so I'm going to put a weird restriction and say **IF YOU SPIN YOUR OWN YARN** to make this, yes you can. If you're using commercial yarn, I would say no. Only because I believe if you do make your own yarn for this simple hat, there will be more of 'your work' going into the hat. Sorry if I sound stupid, but being a handcraft seller myself, I feel there should be more than one layer of originality.
HOWEVER
I support charity.
**IF AND ONLY IF** you are using the pattern for donation or for free knitalongs and teaching materials I am all for it.
**SELLING THE ITEM TO RAISE MONEY FOR DONATIONS** and for knitalongs/teaching materials I definitely would like to be credited one way or the other, but **IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO DONATE DIRECTLY** to charity without 'selling', I don't even care. Don't worry about asking and go right ahead. If something I made is gonna help somebody I can't be more happier.

If you're looking for something simple to try cable for the first time, try this pattern!
If you're an experienced knitter, this will be very quick to knit, so great for last minute gifts!

*Note added 12/31/10*
I have originally posted and recommended size #10 needles for the body, but it seems like many people have been getting a less slouchy result.  **If you want to get a slouchy hat for sure, it might be better to use size #11 for the body.**  Another way to add slouch is to do extra cable repeats before decrease)

*Note added 2/6/12*
I do not have a gauge for this pattern, but for a guide--
Aim for somewhat **loose fabric that drapes a bit**.  If your swatch turns out closely knit and stiff, I would go up a needle, or it will end up being small or beanie-like.
I will try knitting a swatch and figure out the gauge when I get a chance.  Sorry about that!",,2485,3713,4.37,,Bulky

The original hat was a beautiful, simple hat I knit out of a hank of worsted weight handspun yarn from Fiber Optics Gradient Roving. My sweet daughter wore the hat to school one day and then I never saw it again. The hat is lost forever, thus the name of the hat is the Lost Banner Hat.

I made this same hat two more times, one in a hank of yummy Malabrigo Worsted and another in my worsted handspun from Dyeabolical Yarns. 

It's a great, quick, comfy unisex hat that is for children, women, men, teens... everyone! It's a perfect one skein hat needing about 200 yards of worsted weight. 

The stretchy extended ribbed brim makes it fit pretty much any head size with up to 3-4 inches of negative ease. The child size finished measurement is 17.5 inches and the adult size finished measurement is 19 inches. The adult size fits easily on my 22-inch head!

739413,Abby's Ombre Hat,Ruthann Flor,2.06,5.0,1.0,stockinette stitch with larger needles,210.0,"
Abby's Ombre Hat uses colorwork to fade from one color to another.  Individuals who can do simple color work should be able to handle this design.  The fun part about colorwork is the look completely changes depending on the colors you choose.

This hat is designed for an average women's size.  If you need a larger size simply add stitches to the initial cast on in multiples of 4 and additional Color B rows could be added at the top before decrease begins.

Two skeins of Berroco Comfort (2 different colors) will easily make two hats.

I've added a pom-pom, which is optional, because I think pom-poms always add a little fun!

*Feeling all the Autumn Vibes* :: a color dipped hat with a textural arrow band, knit using the two-color brioche stitch. You may recognize the same stitch pattern that was used in my [Summer Vibes][6] shawl! 

The pattern is written specifically for the color dipping shown in the main sample, but feel free to knit it all in just two colors with no color blocks, or add more stripes and color blocks for a super colorful hat! I knit the Small size in just two colors to give you an idea of what it would look like. 

This pattern is both written and charted for your convenience. 

**Skill level:** Beginner Brioche friendly!! Basic two color brioche skills are not required, but are recommended. This is a great project if you'd like to try some brioche increases and decreases. Techniques used: knitting in the round, knit, purl, brioche knit (brk), brioche purl (brp), brioche increases and decreases. 

If you have not yet tried knitting brioche, fear not!! This hat may look complicated, but the twists and turns are made by increasing and decreasing the brioche stitches and are so much fun once you learn! This pattern is written so that ANYONE can knit it, with links to videos teaching the techniques. I also highly recommend visiting Nancy Marchant’s website to learn more: www.briochestitch.com.

**Sizes:** Adult Small (Large): 18 (21)” / 46 (53)cm circ. x 9” / 23cm height (taken after blocking). PLEASE NOTE: The Adult Small instructions could certainly be used for a Child or Toddler!  I have photographed my 3 year-old to show you how it fits him.  It is a bit large on him, but you get the idea.  :) 

**How to choose your size:** This pattern can be knit in two adult sizes: Small for a more fitted look, and Large for a slouchier style. The Small size is meant to be worn with 3 - 4” / 8 - 10cm of negative ease for a fitted version, while the Large size is meant to be worn with 1 - 2” / 2.5 - 5cm of negative ease. The color dipped sample is shown in the Large size, modeled on a 22” / 56cm circ. head. The two color sample is shown in the Small size, modeled on a Toddler head measuring approximately 16"" / 41cm in circumference.

**Yarn for Color Dipped Version:** 165 (190) yds / 151 (174) m DK weight

**NOTE:** Lucky Tweed is a thick and thin woolen spun yarn, your needle size may vary greatly. Testers used a US 5, 6, 7, or 8 needle to achieve correct gauge.

Even though this might seem like a completely normal directional statement, this saying doesn’t have anything to do with direction. When a Minnesotan says “Up North,” what they’re really referring to is their cabin or to the woods, but those don’t need to be in that direction. So no matter where they are going, they’ll say they’re going “up north.” This hat is a complement to the Up North Cabin socks I designed for the #lotsofsockskal and will be great paired with matching mittens.

Brava Worsted Yarn from Knit Picks in Fig or Avocado is a great option.

The ears are, well, quite large. They will most certainly flop down. To help keep them firm I inserted some EVA foam before seaming them up. This is totally optional, but does help. If you don’t have any EVA foam, you could cut out some cardboard from a shipping or cereal box, or try stuffing them with scrap yarn. The benefit of using EVA foam or cardboard is that you can mold the shape a little to give the ears some depth.

The body of the hat is knit flat on the bias. Once desired length of knitting is reached, the two edges (cast on and last row) are grafted together using kitchener stitch to create a tube. One end is gathered with scrap yarn. Then using smaller needles, stitches are picked up on other end and the brim is knit in the round. Lastly, the pom-pom is attached.

These shouldn’t be this enchanting. They really shouldn’t. That bit of fancy business there is just cables (easy cables at that, borderline boring cables). No really, I promise. It’s made from simple little two by two cables, lined up right next to each other and then stacked up one atop the other.

There’s absolutely no reason for it to be this charming. And yet...

I can’t explain it. Maybe it’s something to do with how orderly and tidy and logical they are? Or maybe it’s because they are cables but somehow don’t actually look like cables? Or maybe it’s just me and I am alone in finding them unspeakably endearing?

But somehow I don’t think so. I suspect you probably find them every bit as delightful as I do. Though I was so enamored of this whole project that I had to knit two different hats, which might be a tad bit excessive. It’s totally cool if you just want to make one!

<hr>

**General information**

This 38-page ebook includes patterns for both [Tacit][1] (the mitts) and Implicit (the hats, both versions). (The patterns are only available together as a set, they are not available individually.)

**Skills & scope**

This is an absolutely perfect example of how really simple building blocks (two by two ribbing, really basic cable crosses) can combine to make something magic. There's no fancy business here, just sit back, stack your cables up just so, and it'll all come together in no time!

The pattern uses [charts][2], so you will need to know how to follow a knitting chart.

**Yarn, gauge & sizing**

The mitts come in four sizes (from a 44 stitch cast on to a 56 stitch cast on) and are are written for five gauges (from five and a half to seven and a half stitches per inch in half stitch increments). The hats come in four sizes (from a 96 stitch cast on to a 144 stitch cast on) and are are written for five gauges (from four to six and a half stitches per inch in half stitch increments).

That means you can use just about any weight of yarn from fingering up through worsted, and there will be a size to fit pretty much anyone's wrist or head. Basically anything that will give you a fabric with a drape you like somewhere in that range of gauges will work.

The mitts in the pictures took about 250 yards of dk-weight yarn, the hats between 200 and 225 (it's a single ply yarn held alongside a fuzzy yarn to make it extra warm and fuzzy, and together they come out to about a dk weight). If you're working with thinner yarn, 300 yards for either project is a safer bet.


**Tools & supplies**

You’ll need needles that let you work in the round (circulars or DPNs) in whatever size lets you get a solid fabric with your chosen yarn plus the general knitting tools you need for most projects (scissors to cut your yarn, a darning needle to weave in ends, a cable needle if you like to use those for cables, the occasional stitch marker to keep track of a thumb or bit of scrap yarn to hold stitches).

<hr>

**Note**

The mitts (Tacit) were initially available as a stand alone pattern. Now that the hats (Implicit) are out, the mitts are no longer available as an individual pattern. But I wanted to make sure anyone who has the mitts and wants the hats doesn't have to buy the mitts a second time, so I set up a code that will let folks who already bought Tacit deduct the full price of the mitt pattern from the price of the set. 

**To find the code, make sure you've got the most recent version of the Tacit pattern (an update went out on August 28, 2023), then look for the last paragraph of the Pattern Notes section on page two.** You'll find the code there! It should work right now and will be active as long as the patterns are listed on ravelry.

910371,Bristol Diagonal Ribbed Hat,Bridget Pupillo,1.76,18.0,4.0,Diagonal Rib Pattern,114.0,"Bristol is a salty sailor’s beanie with waves of diagonal ribbing for added texture. Designed to show off Knit Picks' new Muse Hand Painted yarn line, this hat is a quick and simple knit and works well in any colorway. It is worked in the round from the bottom up. The diagonal rib pattern is so easy to create and truly stands out in a crowd. An optional addition to the hat is a faux fur pompom topper.

This hat is sized for an adult small to medium head (21"" head circumference). I include notes on how to adjust the size to make a larger or smaller hat. Please note: any increases to the circumference or height of the hat will require a second hank of Knit Picks Muse yarn.

The gauge is 18 stitches and 26 rows over 4” in Diagonal Rib Pattern.

This pattern is recommended for beginners. You must be able to knit, purl, and decrease using K2tog and P2tog.

For the brilliant blue version featured here, I used 1 hank of Knit Picks Muse (100% Superwash Merino,114 yds/100g per hank) in Visionary Tonal #27847. You will also need 16” circular needles and double pointed needles in size US 8 (5.0mm) or whatever size necessary to obtain the gauge, plus 16"" circular needles in size US 7 (4.5mm) or one size down from size to obtain gauge.

This pattern includes full written instructions as well as a chart, so that you may choose according to your preference. It also includes notes on how to adjust the size (larger or smaller).",,67,58,4.75,Adult Small/Medium,Aran
929295,Fade In to View,Theresa Schabes,1.86,21.0,4.0,reverse stockinette stitch,525.0,"

This hat was designed for the Madison Knitters’ Guild’s 2019 Knit-In Cast-On Party as a celebration of the popular technique of fading color transitions.  Fade In To View is worked in reverse stockinette stitch with two strands of yarns held together, but the composition of those two strands is constantly shifting.  

While the body of the hat is reverse stockinette stitch, it is knit with the wrong side facing.  The hat is then turned inside out when finished.  Fans of purl stitches can, of course, work the body of the hat by purling.

Fade In To View was designed to be knit with variegated or speckled yarn but could also work in semi-solid or solid yarns.  The sample hat fades from the darkest color at the ribbed band to the lightest at the top. An optional pompom of the lightest color may be added. Feel free to arrange your yarns in an order that pleases you.

The Piece of Cake Hat is a family favorite hat pattern that I’ve used over and over again to great success. The hat fits most any size of a grown-ish person’s head ranging from young to old, small to xx-large. The reason for the large size range is the generous ribbed brim which can be folded over a lot, a little, or not folded at all. My daughter has a 21.5-inch head circumference and my husband has a 24-inch head circumference and both can comfortably wear the Piece of Cake Hat.

Piece of Cake Meaning: It is simple to do. It's a job or task that is easy, requiring little effort; a piece of cake. This simple hat is fun, fast and versatile. You’ll love the Piece of Cake for the mindless knitting and the forever wearing.

**Pattern Notes:** 
I’ve knit two samples shown in the pattern, one in Woolens which is a sport weight yarn and one in Home Worsted Weight yarn. 

The pattern is worked exactly the same for both weights of yarn, the only differences are the needle sizes and the stitch counts. When there are differences, the pattern is written with the Woolens information first and the Home Worsted information in the parentheses. When only one instruction is given it applies to both yarn weights.

If you would like to vary the circumference size of the hat for either yarn weight, go up or down in increments of 8 stitches and knit the pattern as is, varying lengths as you see fit.

**Size:** To fit a 20 to 24-inch head circumference for both yarn weights. 

**Yarn:** 
Woolens (100% American Wool); sport weight, 180 yards/50 grams per skein, 2 skeins required. The Thimble colorway is used for the sample.

Home Worsted Weight (100% American Climate Beneficial Wool); 230 yards/100 grams per skein, 1 skein required. The Folkstone colorway is used for the sample.

**Needles:**
**For Woolens (sport):** 
Brim: US size 3/3.25mm, 16-inch circular 
Body of Hat: US size 5/3.75mm, 16-inch circular and double-pointed needles

With this fun free pattern, we took our favorite Basic Beanie and gave it a bit of extra length for a nice, cozy cuff! This hat is just about as easy as can be knit all in straightforward stockinette stitch with swirling decreases to finish. And a bulky-weight yarn promises it’ll be off your needles in—if not a few hours—a few nights of knitting!

For this adorable, cuffed beanie, we chose Sirdar Alpine—a superbly soft and supremely pettable bulky-weight yarn. Akin to a fringed ribbon and crafted entirely in polyester, Alpine is also machine-washable—perfect for this playful, fluffy hat.

I initially intended to make a simple hat for a friend of mine who went to college in Maine.  However, she is also a Louise Penny fan so altering the pattern to include three pine trees instead of just one became necessary. I am so pleased with the result, I am sharing my pattern.  

In addition to resizing it, I added a folded brim along with some decorative broken rib patterning between the trees and a different crown decrease.  I also modified how the pine tree was constructed for smoother branch lines.

While there are no difficult stitch patterns involved, it does require an attention to detail which some may find challenging.

We continue to be overwhelmed at the positive reception to our Year of Hats from 2019, and it was a no brainer to do it again in Germantown Bulky!

Courtney really likes to shake things up in the spring with some [wild hat designs][1] and bold colors, and Ivy Hill is no exception.

Ivy Hill is bobblicious! These bobbles are big and bold and fun to knit. The hat starts with a garter rib and jumps into a bobble diamond pattern - both written and charted - before decreasing in pattern for the crown. The bobbles are worked over 5 stitches, and keeping them loose and even is crucial for purling all 5 stitches together (like a modified nupp). This hat is so cheerful and fun, and the Germantown Bulky makes it knit up so fast it'll be on your head in time for St. Paddy's Day.

**Worthy of Note**
This heavily bobbled hat is worked in the round from the bottom up. When working the bobble, be sure to keep the tension of the stitches even and loose enough to knit into. It may take some practice to get the tension just right so that your bobbles look tidy, but the yarn can handle it. The bobbles use a lot of yarn, so be sure to check your gauge if you want to ensure that you have enough yarn for a pompom.

Thoughtful details — seamless transitions from the brim ribbing to the cables, hidden crown decreases, and optional tubular edges — also combine for an overall polished effect. Choose between two brim styles and top off with a jaunty pom-pom, or leave unadorned to showcase the vanishing cable motifs.

The design is worked seamlessly in the round, in 2 colour brioche. The winged motif is echoed around the hat and is interspersed with two colour vertical stripes, culminating at the top to form trident spears and art deco points. 

Valkyrie is knit with the fabulous Rios from Malabrigo Yarns. There are two sizes; Small, and Medium - Large. It also has two lengths – wear it slouchy or as a regular beanie – you decide!

There are several video tutorials included with this pattern to help you work through the various brioche stitches, and other techniques to prevent jogging in garter stitch in the round.

",225.0,"A beautiful dark heather and a gorgeous subtly shaded yellow, paired with a slight halo and some fun cables.  Penderyn is my favorite kind of hat!  This Black and Blue DK from Midwinter Yarns is both soft and sheepy, and the different shades and depth in this fiber really make the cables pop. 

The cables themselves are quite interesting, with center twists and outer brackets that easily morph into both a cool brim pattern and a beautiful crown. I'm always a fan of a pom, and with the generous yardage on the Black and Blue DK, I had to add one to the yellow hat - but I also knit a second hat from stash just so you can see the detail.  (Stash hat is knit in Berroco Lanas, in the Sage Colorway)

**Yardage by size:**

***Yarn***
175(200,225)yards

Heavy DK or light worsted weight yarn needed. 
I suggest a subtly shaded or solid colorway so detail will show up, and a yarn with a bit of memory for a well fitting hat. 

Swatch in cable pattern to be sure of gauge. 

Overall size of hat can be adjusted by working pattern in a different gauge, and hat depth can be adjusted by working a shallower or deeper brim. 

Cable instructions are both charted and written.

Vimmer is a great project for using up odds and ends of colors and displaying them in the striped razor shell lace pattern.
This beanie is generous in length and definitely on the slouchy side so if you prefer somethings closer fitting I suggest omitting some of the rows of the lace pattern.

""Vimmer"" is a Shetland word meaning to quiver/tremble.

**Size**
Circumference at brim: 18 ½” / 47cm
Length from brim to crown as worn: 9 ½” / 24cm

**Needles**
US 4 / 3.5mm circular needle, 16” / 40cm length (for brim of hat)
US 5 / 3.75mm circular needle, 16” /40cm length (for body of hat)
US 5 /3.75mm DPNs or long circular needle (if working magic loop for crown of hat)
Always use a needle size that will result in the correct gauge after blocking.

**Yarn**
Fingering weight yarn in the following amounts:
100 yards MC 
50 yards CC1 (Allow approx. 40 extra yards if making a pom pom using CC1).
35 yards CC2
25 yards CC3
Note: If changing the stripe sequence then plan for approx. 8 yards per 2 rounds of Razor Shell Lace.

**Notes**
As this hat is worked in a garter stitch background it is incredibly stretchy. This means you can really shape and stretch it during the blocking process. Yardage for each 2 rounds of the Razor Shell Lace pattern is given above in case you wish to change the stripe sequence to suit your yarn amounts (great way to use up scraps).

Wanted to design a simple ribbed beanie with a bit of flair using a single skein of Malabrigo Noventa.   The colors pictured are Cape Cod Grey and Black Forest. This beanie was fast and fun to knit and would be great for other bulky weight yarns.  Hope you enjoy!

Errata: There was an error in the first day's release of the pattern.   On pattern rounds part 1, it should say: Work rounds 1 and 2 below 10 times to create 5 garter ridges in your “patch,” instead of 10 garter ridges.

**CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNIQUE**
This hat is knit in two pieces. The brim is worked
separately, sideways, beginning with a provisional cast
on. The brim features a braided cable motif, and an
i-cord edge. The brim is finished by undoing the
provisional cast on and attaching it to the working edge
using Kitchener stitch. Stitches are picked up and knit around the
circumference of the brim for the remainder of the hat.
The body of the hat is knit using stranded colorwork
technique. Crown shaping uses standard ssk and k2tog
decreases, and the hat is finished by cutting the yarn
and weaving the tail through the remaining live stitches.

The textured fabric of the Admix Hat was designed to combine different yarns of the same weight for interesting color and texture effects. Choose two or more DK weight yarns with contrasting colors, dye processes or fiber contents to create unique fabrics. Here, we combine a sturdy workhorse solid-dyed wool (*Arbor*) with a tonally-dyed cotton-merino blend (*Dapple*). The softer color transitions of hand- or tonal- dyed yarns shift and mix gently when interspersed with a solid base in a coordinating or complementary color.

This unique hat, made with a moebius twist, is deceptively simple to knit. The main portion of Quincy is worked as a flat strip of garter stitch, knit back-and-forth with built-in I-cord on both sides. When this piece reaches sufficient length, the fabric is given a half-twist and the ends are then grafted together using kitchener stitch. You will now have a moebius strip from which you will pick up crown stitches. Crown shaping is worked traditionally, in the round, from this point onward to close the top.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Construction**

* The body of the hat begins with a Provisional Cast On and is worked flat in garter stitch with an I-cord edging on both sides.
* Upon completion of the body section, the fabric is given a half-twist to create a moebius strip and the ends are grafted together using Kitchener Stitch.
* Construction/folding illustrations are included to show the folding process.
* Stitches are picked up from one edge of the moebius strip for the crown, which is then worked traditionally in the round.

I've completely revamped Brioche Pastiche for my beginning brioche classes. Knit a hat or a cowl; I've got you covered. We start with an introduction to 2 color brioche rib. From there we have options to continue in rib if you'd like a plain hat or cowl, or move into increases and decreases to form the climbing leaves.

There are 2 crown shapings for the hat, a 4 section swirl, and a 6 section swirl. So many options!

****************

Pastiche: A piece consisting of motifs or techniques borrowed from other sources. I’ve taken my favorite elements from two designs in my Brioche Hat Trick Collection, and recombined them especially for my 2 color brioche in the round knitting classes. 

Two contrasting colors will make your brioche dreams come true.

July 2020: I’ve added a tutorial for another way to handle the tricky bits at the beginning/end of rounds; see my [PDXKnitterati Tutorials page][1] if you’d like to try an alternate way.

>This design is a fundraising effort for the Morton Rutledge Fire Company in honor of my brother in law, Daniel Clement, who passed away in September. 

This hat was designed using Queen City Yarn Biddleville DK at a gauge of 22 stitches and 28 rows to 4 inches (10 cm) on larger needles in the round. I used Home Team Grey and knit an Adult Medium in the slouchy length for the sample.

Size: Baby (Toddler, Child/Adult Small, Adult Medium, Adult Large)

Circumference: 15 (16, 18, 20 , 22) inches, unstretched.

Slouchy version 8 (9.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5) inches from brim to top.

I’ve knit many hats for my brothers over the years. Daniel wore his all the time and was so proud to tell people, “My sister made it!” He requested a new one the day before he passed away. Daniel was a hero in many rights, serving his community in the United States Air Force, as an EMT, Police Officer, and most recently as Captain of the Morton Rutledge Fire Company. One of the many tasks he thoroughly enjoyed was organizing the fundraising efforts for his fire company. I have written this design, Hat for Dan, in his memory and will be donating proceeds from pattern sales to his fire company in an effort to continue to show support in his honor.

 It is helpful (but not necessary), if you use interchagable needles for this pattern. That way you can keep a smaller needle on your left hand needle to allow the stitches to slide with ease.

1295366,Claire's Hat,Marcus Hartzler,3.33,30.0,4.0,,350.0,"I first made this hat for my daughter, Claire, towards the beginning of 2022. I loved how it turned out, and throughout the year I kept coming back to that design. When my wife would ask what I was making, I would tell her, ""Another hat like Claire's.""

I think that the hat is more than the sum of its parts. The colors almost melt into each other from a distance, but close-up you notice the chevron pattern that the stripes create. In total though, there are only 18 rows of stranded colorwork, making this a great pattern for someone new to stranded knitting. It's also good for people with a colorful stash of fingering weight leftovers.

As with many of my designs, Succulent Garden attempts to pay tribute to the plants for which it is named. With their vibrant colors and juicy leaves, succulents can be one of the most rewarding types of plants to grow. It’s often stated that succulents are easy to care for and thus the best plants for beginners, but in my experience they can be tricky. If you’re interested in taking a succulent into your home but don’t know where to start, here is my advice: choose a healthy jade or aloe that is not too small (baby plants have smaller root systems and can be quite finicky), and ensure the pot has a drainage hole. Find a sunny window, and plop your new friend right by the sill. Most succulents prefer some direct sunlight, so a south-facing window for Northern hemisphere folks or a north-facing window for Southern hemisphere folks is best. If your succulent is getting lots of direct sun, water it weekly--particularly if your pot is clay, as these tend to dry out the soil faster. If your succulent is getting little to no direct sun, water every two weeks. In the winter, add another week to the time between waterings.

Milkweeds are herbaceous perennials celebrated for their ability to attract swarms of pollinators, including butterflies, moths, bees and wasps. More famously, milkweed is the food plant of the monarch butterfly larva. The flowers of these plants can be white, pink or orange depending on the variety. In the humid summers of the South, these flowers can be seen dotting patches of brush and skirting the pine and deciduous forests. They are always a pleasing sight! This hat design is inspired by these gorgeous plants.

A fun project turning a basic beanie style into something unique.  Just pull out your basket of leftover balls of yarn.  Pick the colors at random, or mix and match until you get the look you want.  Change colors as often as you like.

The hat begins with simple k2,p2 ribbing.  Then turn to the 21-round chart with an 8-stitch repeat.  Of the 21 rounds, 19 rounds are stranded.

Then you finish the hat like any other basic beanie.

Now, a year later, I've decided to give it a try - but first, I wanted to practice a little bit and get familiar with the cable pattern used on the sweater.

This hat gives plenty of opportunity to practice - and it's a nice way to get cables to go around the head without having to work sideways. To avoid going crazy on some of the cable rounds, I recommend checking out a tutorial on cabling without a cable needle.

880890,Favorite Cable Beanie,Lindsey Faciane,2.36,8.5,2.0,Stockinette stitch,160.0,"One of my favorite things about being a knitter is that whenever I see a pretty cable knit beanie while I’m out shopping, I’m not tempted to buy it because I know I can make an even nicer one myself! Not only does this save me lots of money, I get to enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that I made my clothes with my own two hands. Rather than being inspired by a beloved book, album, or hiking trail, this piece was designed to be both enjoyable to knit and a staple in your wardrobe! I want this Favorite Cable Beanie design to be one of those classics that you want to cast on again as soon as you’re finished making one, as well as a timeless piece that you will want to wear with every outfit, sell at your local market, and gift to everyone you know!


The Favorite Cable Beanie features twisted cables of varying widths, staggered in a unique way that adds visual interest and doesn’t get boring to knit. Worked in a worsted weight yarn, the thick cables are delightfully squishy, and the beanie has a slouchy, comfortable style that looks good on everyone! This pattern is ideal for the adventurous beginner, as I’ve included a tutorial on knitting cables that you might find helpful if you're new to cabling. You will find the complete instructions for three different size options written out in this pattern: adult, child, and toddler.


I made the pattern sample using one of my very favorite yarns, [Lion Brand Yarn “Vanna’s Choice”][1] in the color Barley. Fun fact: I bought this yarn several years ago for my very first project when I was teaching myself to knit! There are so many reasons that I love this yarn: it’s very soft, has a lovely drape, is extremely affordable, is readily available, and there are DOZENS of gorgeous colors to choose from! Also, Lion Brand donates a portion of each sale of “Vanna’s Choice” to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and I think we can all agree on how great that is. 


***MATERIALS***

* Approximately 145 (110, 80) yds of worsted weight (4) yarn. For the pattern sample, I made an adult sized beanie with [Lion Brand Yarn “Vanna’s Choice”][2] in Barley.
  
* US Size 8 (5mm) 16” circular knitting needles + US Size 8 (5mm)  double-pointed knitting needles (dpns are optional, but recommended)

* Stitch markers (optional)
  
* Cable needle

* Yarn needle

* Scissors


***MEASUREMENTS***

Adult:	Approx. 18.5” around  x  9” tall
Child:	Approx. 15” around  x  8” tall
Toddler:	Approx. 13” around  x  7” tall


***GAUGE***

8.5 sts  x  12 rows  =  2” in stockinette stitch

Enjoy texture, both quiet and luxurious, with the Treefolds Hat. Allover cables developed as a modern take on traditional Tree of Life cable patterns is the highlighting feature of this stately hat. Trees abstracted into diamonds are created by zigzagging cable panels placed next to each other in mirroring directions. Blending seamlessly with these cable crosses are fully-fashioned double decreases at the crown, which result in a uniquely geometric design at the top of the hat. In fingering-weight Peerie, these anfractuous cables render crisply and remain spritely, substantial, and comfortable to wear on many an adventure.

--------------------------------------------------------

903883,Lake Effect Snow Hat,Laura Cunitz,3.15,4.0,4.0,stockinette,140.0,"This chunky brimmed hat has lots of interesting features that make it fun to knit and wear. It is my personal go-to hat when I am out shoveling snow where I live in Lake Tahoe. They include: 

* A decorative cast on the really stands out on the folded brim 
* A pretty faux cable rib brim. 
* A hidden plain 3x3 rib to help with fit 
* The crown is shaped with a raised star pattern 
* And, one more, the top is closed in 2-tiers to keep the amazing texture.  
   
There is also a matching cowl with a decorative bind off that uses up the yarn for the 2nd skein needed for the Medium size hat. 

**Hat Size and important yardage info**

**Small / Medium**: 18” (19)” circumference, 8 (9)” height from fold
**Yardage**: Small 128 yds.  Medium: 140 yds
The hat is stretchy so the real determination of size is in the height. 

**Small:** (white) knit on US 8 used 1 entire skein (127 yds). The width fit multiple people but some needed a longer length to cover their ears. 

**Medium**: (blue) brim and rib knit with a US 9 (5.5 mm), the top on a US 8 (5mm). 
This give the base more room to stretch but it uses just over 1 skein (136 yds) which drives me crazy so I added a bonus cowl pattern to use up the yarn. You could knit 2 hats with 3 skeins.

**Cowl Size** 
Cowl is designed to use up extra yarn from the 2nd skein required for the medium hat. 
One Size: 21” circumference, 6.5” height. 

**Yarn/ Gauge**
Cascade 128 Superwash: 100% Superwash wool, 128 yds/100g skein,  label gauge 3.5 sts/1” (14 sts 4”/ 10 cm) on US 10 (6 mm). 
Knit to 4 sts / 1” on US 8 (5 mm).
Alternative: chunky Alpaca yarn like Plymouth Baby Alpaca Grande. Only has 110 yds per skein so 2 required for all sizes.

**Support**

* The pattern has both written
  instructions and charts
* Written tutorials for the Resilient
  Cast On, Two-Tier Hat Top and optional
  Knotted K2tog Bind Off are included
* There are video tutorials available

This is my basic beanie that stays on quite well in the hospital after birth. It's great for newborn photography, a quick new baby gift, and can easily be whipped up in an hour or two. Any worsted weight yarn will do.

I use this for charitable knitting for my local hospitals as well and I can usually get 4-5 hats out of one skein of Berroco Vintage. Any yarn can be substituted and you can size up by increasing stitches by a factor of 8.",,35,17,4.86,Newborn (0-1 month),Aran
1111548,Porter Square Hat,Sophie Veksler,1.73,18.0,4.0,Stockinette,200.0,"This hat is named after Porter Square, located on the border of Cambridge and Somerville in Massachusetts. While it's not really a ""square"" as much as nearby Harvard Square or Davis Square, it's got a lot of great restaurants and shops, making it an underrated staple. 

In the same vein - though this hat looks simple, it has quickly become a favorite winter accessory. The squishy brim will keep your ears warm, and the stripe detail gives the hat a classic look. With an aran weight yarn, this hat knits up in no time!

I first learned to knit cables in a phone call with my Grandma Margery. It was back in the day of long distance calling and early home internet, and frankly, I had no one else to ask. She cleared it up for me quickly: cables are just stitches that cross over other stitches – that’s it. It was so simple I couldn’t believe I had to ask. But we all start somewhere, don’t we? Thank goodness for cables - they’re the star of the show in this close-fitting little beanie.

Its eggs are black, and young Ridgebacks develop the ability to shoot flame earlier than any other breeds (around one to three months). Female Ridgebacks are generally more ferocious than the males.”

We love a classic beanie—but pretty stranded colorwork makes this free pattern the fairest of them all! Just above a band of cozy ribbing (promising a comfy, snug fit), colorwork flurries and flakes drift around your noggin. The snowflake has a traditional Nordic look that’s got us dreaming of snowy romps.

We knit the Snowflake Beanie in a fine woolly wool—Jamieson’s Shetland Spindrift. A fingering-weight, woolen-spun yarn made from the fleece of hardy, wee Shetland sheep. Nice and lofty, it has the perfect toothy texture and gorgeous color palette.

**The ribbing is knitted with US size 2 needles and the chart is knitted with US size 3 needles.**

Here's the colors I used:

Knit Picks Palette (fingering weight 100% wool yarn)
MC1 - Rooibos Heather	        75 yds
MC2 - Abyss Heather		28 yds
CC1 - Almond			        34 yds
LB1 - Suede			        13 yds
LB2 - Bittersweet Heather	13 yds

There are 5 color in this hat. If you choose colors that you already have consider using 3 dark shades and 2 light shades.  For contrast, the Latvian braid should have 1 light color and 1 dark color.  The background colors (main color 1 and main color 2) are both dark.  The contrasting color is light and is the same for all the stranded colorwork.  I used Knit Pick's Palette but you could use other fingering weight yarns. Of course I recommend 100% wool.

This pattern was born of a gift.  I received four skeins of Shelter for the holidays.  I loved how the colors looked together so much, I wanted to make a design that let the tweeds play off of each other.  I had plenty of yarn remaining to make two hats swapping each color combo.   The brim is designed to be extra tall (a different take on the proportions of a traditional beanie), but would easily be modified to make a smaller brim.  Hope you enjoy!

*A note about the fit and ribbing:  Some knitters have noted that the ribbing in the brim seems loose as written.  If this is a concern, I would suggest one of 2 things:  Cast on using a needle 3 sizes smaller than gauge needle, and/or work a 1x1 rib instead of the 2x1 rib.  
Designer is a tight knitter, so be sure to check gauge.  If you would like a more fitted hat, size down in needles.*

Architectural lines and innovative construction elevate an aviator cap you can knit with a single skein of *Shelter*. Lolo is worked sideways from a provisional cast-on; crown shaping is achieved with short rows while increases and decreases form a sinuous brim that covers the ears. Lines of slipped stitches flow across the garter background to accentuate the shaping and create sculptural shifts in texture. This unisex hat can be knit in multiple sizes by changing needle size and gauge; directions are given for 18” and 20” circumferences. Block the finished cap over a steep-sided bowl or other head-shaped form to correct excessive angularity. 

--------------------------------------------------------

**Construction**

The hat begins with a Crocheted Provisional Cast On at center back, and is worked from side to side with Short Rows: Wrap & Turn Method, in a garter and slipped stitch pattern to highlight shaping. The earflaps are integrated through increases and decreases. The end of the hat is joined to the beginning with Joinery Bind Off. Stitches are picked up around the short crown edge of hat, and a few rounds are worked circularly to close the crown of the hat.

**Yardage**

140 (150) yards of worsted weight wool yarn

**Yarn**

1 (2) skein(s) of Brooklyn Tweed *Shelter* (100% American Targhee-Columbia wool; 140 yards/50g)

Photographed in color *Wool Socks* (Size Small/Medium) & *Soot* (Size Large)

**Gauge**

Size Small/Medium: 20 stitches & 40 rows (20 ridges) = 4"" in garter stitch, after blocking

Size Large: 18 stitches & 36 Rows (18 ridges) = 4"" in garter stitch, after blocking

**Needles**

One pair of straight needles or a 32″ circular needle* in size needed to obtain gauge listed for size you are making 

Suggested Size:
Size Small/Medium: 4 1/2 mm (US 7)

**Scarf**: Approx. 26 sts = 4""/10cm on gauge needle in scarf cable pattern, after blocking.
__________________________________________________

The cable pattern in the beanie is very elastic and will stretch to fit comfortably around a small to large size adult head.

As stitches stretch, however, they shorten up a little, so for a larger size (22–24"") we’ve added ½""/1cm of length to the ribbing.

For a custom fit, measure your head from brow bone (or wherever you would like the beanie to sit on your forehead) over your head to the base of your skull. Divide this number in half, and subtract 6""/15.25cm (length of all cable rounds, including decrease rounds). The remainder is the length of ribbing you’ll need to knit.

764205,Head Hug Chemo Cap,Laura DeFlora,2.1,5.0,1.0,stockinette,,"
This chemo cap pattern started when a friend asked for a soft cotton chemo cap to keep her head warm after her treatments. The hat became so popular that I began to knit more for other friends, as they needed Head Hugs during their own treatments.  I always wondered if the hat was truly comfortable and useful, or if my friends were just being nice.  Now I know – it is!  During my own chemo and radiation, I wore it so often I made it in 3 different colors (if you make one, cream is the best first choice).  The fancy rib stitch has a bit of flex giving the hat a nice gentle fit and a bit of style, and the easy-care cotton yarn is great for day or sleeping.  Plus, the hat gets a lot of compliments .

- It takes about 150 yards of worsted or light aran weight yarn.  Easy care is best, cotton or cotton blend.  

- This hat has a lot of stretch, so it hugs almost every head size comfortably.  

-  The fancy rib looks a lot more difficult to knit than it is!

I decided to write up the pattern and share it here so anyone can make a cap for someone who needs a hug. A comfortable, useful, and stylish chemo hat is really hard to find and I hope you find this one to be just that! I hope wearing this hat brings a little hug to you or anyone you give it to anytime they need it, with wishes of good health, and comfort.",,76,53,5.0,One-size-fits-most women,Worsted

If you agree, purchase both Oban AND Glenfidditch together and you'll get $3.00 off your total purchase. Code GIFTHATS. This code does not expire. Because gifts can always be knit! **

Glenfidditch is my favorite kind of knit because it's addictive to watch the lines of the cables evolve as you work, and you know how I feel about tweedy, heathered wools. The geometric design is bold and distinct and allows for a great diagonal transition at the brim.  Twisted cables inside other cables make for a ""paneled"" effect that lends itself to a almost star-like effect on top. 

Craig requested a hat that would cover his entire ear, so this hat has a tad more depth than I usually design with.  It can be worn down low on your head to cover those ears, or tilted back for just a little slouch. 

Instructions are included for modifying depth/width.  The Wisconsin Woolen Spun is fantastic yarn, but it's available in limited quantities, so Green Mountain Spinnery's Weekend Wool is wonderfully similar stuff. Both are locally sourced US fibers - squishy and round and soft and wooly. And both come in such gorgeous, complex, heathered shades that will make these cables shine.

This pattern will require color working in the round. You will need to have floats in some rounds (this is not very complicated to do, so an adventurous beginner should have no issues with this hat).

The pattern contains two charts-one for the smaller Sasquatch and one for the taller Sasquatch, you may choose whichever chart you want to follow, this is a choose your own ending. There is a video included in the pattern that will show you how I personally make my faux fur pom poms, my way is a bit messy but is far faster than some of the other methods (there are others videos out there if you want to find a less messy way).

This pattern has been tested for errors by my amazing testers and I would like to extend to them my deepest gratitude. Without you, my little dream would only be a fantastical dream, much like bigfoot! :)

1204582,Pirr Hat,Vivian Shao Chen,2.25,18.0,4.0,Stockinette,410.0,"The Pirr Hat is a double layered knit hat. 

The double layer is achieved by knitting the hat as one continuous closed tube. You begin at the exterior crown and increase towards the body. The body and cuff are knitted without increases. The stitches are then decreased toward the interior crown and grafted closed. The hat is folded in half wrong sides together at the midpoint. To shape the hat, the interior crown is nested into the exterior crown and the cuff folded up.

Since it is knit completely seamlessly in stockinette stitch in the round, no purl stitches are required for this pattern.

The Pirr Hat is rated an Intermediate level of difficulty. Techniques required:
- Judy’s Magic Cast On
- Knitting in the round with Magic Loop method
- Kitchener stitch

A ribbed and cabled beanie with a brim that can be worked deep enough to fold over and pull down over your ears or left shorter for a cleaner look. Cables grow out of the ribbing with a simple cross that travels across the rib to form four bold triangles around the hat. Shaping is worked neatly into the pattern with pairs of ribs and rope cables coming together at the crown. Add a pom-pom to up the cute factor or leave it off to highlight the architectural lines of the crown. 

Three sizes are provided and each is charted separately for a user friendly knitting experience.

YARN
Worsted weight yarn with good loft and a woolly texture, woollen spun wool or wool blends are ideal. A smoother yarn could be used for a crisper texture.

645884,Love & Courage Chemo Cap,Lisa McFetridge,2.5,22.0,4.0,"stranded stockinette stitch, blocked",210.0,"Kathy Korona (knitter extraordinaire) from the Ames Free Library in Easton, MA asked for a chemo cap pattern that the library knitting group (read more about this library at the end of the pattern) could make to donate to cancer patients.   It needed to be simple enough for the newest knitters, with some “upgrades” for knitters ready for a challenge.  After some thought, this is what I came up with and why:  
 
Cancer sucks.  And many of the medications used to treat it are godsends that can bring very unwelcome side effects.  My neighbor has lived with breast cancer for too many years and of all she has endured, the thing that bothers her most is the loss of her hair.  So if hair has to go, then something lovely should replace it.  This cap has a rolled brim that can be knit 2 ways, a single roll or a double roll (in photo) which gives it a hefty brim to surround the face.   Plus there is an optional Swirl knit in a contrasting color.

When I helped the Old South Church in Boston distribute hand-made scarves to athletes on the 1 year anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombing, we were asked to wrap the scarf around his/her neck and to say that each scarf was hand-knit with “Love and Courage.”   Though you may never meet the person who wears it, consider attaching a note telling the recipient that each cap was knit with love and courage to help the wearer on their journey with cancer.

**A little more about the Ames Free Library in Easton, MA....**

These days a library is more than a library.   This library’s “ little knitting group”  has been sort of a catalyst to having other groups at the library start up. They now have a quilting group, a beading group and a needle workers group.  I can personally attest to the charity of the group.  After designing the Boston Strong Hat in 2013, I spoke to the group and helped them cast on their own hats.  One day someone from the library dropped off a big bag of the hats to give to survivors.  They were much loved!

Ames Free Library Knitters have knit over 100 preemie hats in 2015 which were distributed to neonatal units in Massachusetts.  They have also sold items so they can be self-supporting.  This past Christmas a beautiful blanket was created by the group. Patrons were encouraged to submit a name of someone who they thought deserved it.  All that was required was a name and way of contacting the winner.

Ames Free Library is again a finalist for the Best Small Library in America! ",,76,118,4.59,"Small/med,  med/lg",DK

**Materials**
Yarn:

[Shown knit in Bumblebee Acres Farm’s Coquette Sock in color “Professor Lupin” and ""Rainbow Dalmatian Plantation""][1]

**Needles and Notions:**
~ For Worsted/Aran version:
	- US 8 circular needles 
 		16” cord
	- US 8 DPNs or longer cord for circulars in order to do magic loop at crown decrease
~ For Fingering/Sock and DK version:

**Sizing and Gauge:** Brimmed Hat Version is meant to fit with a good amount of positive ease. Kap Version is meant to be a tad tighter than its brimmed counterpart. This hat is meant to fit differently on different people, and the brimmed version will be a bit more snug on a man. The Kap Version will fit most growing teens like the Brimmed Version fits adults. A smaller or larger hat can be created by casting on more or less stitches in a multiple of 4.

**Abbreviations**
K:knit 
P: purl 
K2tog: knit two Stitches together 
SSK: slip two Stitches, knit together through back loop 
P2tog: purl two Stitches together
Asterisks denote repeat of sequence for each round.

 
**Important Notes**
The Fingering/Sock Version is knit using two strands of Fingering/Sock Weight yarn held together (to make a thicker, DK weight yarn).
 Mrs. Weasley recommends knitting your hat in doubled Coquette Sock Yarn from Bumblebee Acres Farm. This yarn is extra warm, extra woolly, and is magically nonskrinking!
Your hat may magically pool colors! If using Doubled Sock Yarn, or any other home-potion-dyed sock yarn, ball wind your yarn and make sure your ends from the outside and inside of the ball match in their color sequencing, if you want this swrily, magical effect! It is alright it these variegate in more than one place, but as
long as one sequence always lines up, it will create a delicious swirl or color pool effect
in your hat! To create a somewhat perfectly matched swirl/color pool with limited
variegation, create two balls and line up the sequences. To avoid this, just don’t let those sequences line up!
Mrs. Weasley says she also loves completely variegated hats, as they have something inexplicably homie about them! This is ESPECIALLY true for Handspun Hats!

975792,Black Ash Hat,Mat Kladney,2.25,15.0,4.0,stockinette,200.0,"This pattern is a great introduction to colorwork for beginner knitters.  It uses mosaic techniques to create a faux-brioche piece of fabric.  The pattern explains how to do all of this, so give it a try!

Because the hat is knit using mosaic knitting techniques you never have to carry two colors at once, instead you just alternate colors every row. When you finish one row, just drop the yarn you just used and pick up the yarn from the previous row. Perfect for anyone who wants to try colorwork but hasn’t mastered fair isle. Additionally, this pattern is a great introduction to my more complicated mosaic inspired hats [Skenoto Hat][1] and [Palisaides Hat][2].

Make sure you read the knitting notes before starting and don't forget always **slip purlwise with the yarn in the back**.  

The pattern comes with three sizes - adult small/medium/large and the pattern itself results in a pretty stretchy fabric, so there is some forgiveness with regards to size.  You'll want to be comfortable with knit/purl/slip stitch/K2tog as well as knitting in the round.  You'll need around 75-100y of each color you decide to use.

He requested a wool hat with skulls on it to wear at his cross country meets. He also asked that I add in some lightning bolts in honor of his team’s name  the “North Shore Storm.” I love this season of harvest, of darkness and of letting go with the new year on our horizon. I get kind of an expecting-mama’s burst of energy this time of year, scurrying around cooking, cleaning and making all the things, so I was happy to oblige his request for this speedy, spooky knit - just in time for Halloween!

This adorable hat is the simplest colorwork project in the book. The yarn is fat, the pattern is simple, and the hat works up in a flash. Another thing that makes Lars easy is that the
colorwork is knit before the hat is shaped, so you can focus on the pattern first and then the decreases. No multitasking here. The Lars Hat is knit with Studio Donegal’s Soft Donegal then slightly felted to make it extra cozy.  I love the shape and fit of this hat!!

SKILL LEVEL:

Adventurous Beginner to Intermediate for the scarf. Experience working in the round recommended for the cowl. In addition to having experience working in the round, at least one brioche project should be completed before making the hat.
 
Notes From the Designer:

Brioche knitting creates a wonderfully thick and stretchy fabric. It is ideal for cozy accessories or a bulky pullover. This pattern introduces you to the methods used to create brioche fabric. Keeping the designs in one color will help you to focus on learning the technique before jumping into the slightly more complicated two-color version.

If this is your first brioche project, begin with the scarf. An option for inserting blocks of double brioche is provided. Once you have mastered the stitches and are comfortable with working in the round, give the cowl a try. Although the hat is a little more advanced, with your new brioche skills, this will be a great addition to your set!

* Click [here][5] to view a tutorial on
  some tips and tricks to help you learn
  how to successfully knit Brioche.
* When counting rows, realize that each knit stitch represents two rows. This is because it is worked in one row and slipped in the next. When checking gauge, you should count 19 knit stitches in 4”, which is actually 38 rows.
* While learning how to work brioche, it is highly recommended that you use lifelines. If you need to rip back, it can be very confusing to find your stitches and yarn overs without one!
* On RS rows, slip the first stitch knitwise, wyib. On WS rows, slip the first stitch purlwise, wyif. All other slipped stitches are worked with the needle inserted as if to purl.
* Knitting brioche requires making a yarn over and slipping a stitch. With practice, you will be able to do this in one fluid movement. This is referred to as “sl1yo.”

This design came about because I noticed that there weren't very many hat patterns that could accommodate my hair. They were too short to cover my ears. Or the brim was so loose that the hat couldn't be warm and cozy. I decided to create a hat that was infinitely customizable and suitable for big, beautiful hair. The brim is worked flat and not seamed. This allows for you to pin it closed for just the right amount of snugness. The body of the hat is knit extra long to give enough space to tuck your hair in to get it off of your neck. Wear with with the split open in the back and you still get perfect ear coverage. This hat is just right for giant curls, long locs, voluminous braids, and everything else. The pattern includes instructions on how to make the perfect size for your tresses.

I had this idea to make a bobber hat for a child of parents who run a resort in Northern Minnesota. It turned out so cute that I decided to design the Bobber hat. I used the red and blue theme because the colors popped but using more realistic fish buttons would be a great option. Out of that idea, came the concept for adding themed buttons to other children’s hats, so I designed a companion piece called the Boxed Buttons Hat.

This hat pattern is an introduction to colorwork knitting. If you were looking to practice this technique, the super bulky yarn and the repetitive pattern with shorter floats will provide the perfect occasion to do so.

The pattern is written is US standard terms and includes child and adult sizes. It is recommended for intermediate knitters.

Two different colors yarn will be needed to create the hat. Solid or tonal colors will best showcase the pattern design. If using a variegated yarn, use the ones where the lightest color in the darker skein is darker than in the lighter skein and vice versa.

Rhythmic all-over cables in *Shelter* produce a handsome, seaworthy cap that’s quick and satisfying to knit. After a short band of 1 x 1 rib, the hat breaks into a geometric motif of interlocking tiered cables. Perfect for knitters who have tried some basic cables and feel ready for more challenge, the charts are predictable and easy to memorize. The pattern includes a modification for a slightly shorter beanie length.

Deep texture means the pattern won’t be lost in dark colors, so this design is a good choice for *Cast Iron, Soot, Artifact, Old World*, or *Plume*.

""Fast & fabulous.""
This Super Bulky Ribbed Hat is fast, fun, and fabulous. This free pattern uses a super-chunky-weight yarn in a simple two-by-two rib—the result is a cozy, marshmallow-y squish! Whether you knit up a taller, two-toned version or choose a snugger fit in one shade, the Super Bulky Ribbed Hat is a super-quick knit and a great, last-minute gift!

We knit both of these cuddly hats in super-chunky-weight Crazy Sexy Wool from Wool and the Gang—it takes two skeins for the two-color hat, and just one for the one-color! A single ply of plump Peruvian wool, Crazy Sexy Wool is soft, squishy, stretchy—and so fun on your needles. Plus, Wool and the Gang sources this cozy yarn from happy South American sheep, with consideration to reduce the impact on the environment.

One, I wanted an everyday, wear-it-all-the-time beanie, and I personally love a little structure and shape, but couldn’t find a design out there I liked. So I started designing with the crown in mind. 
Two, I wanted to use up stash, and no pattern out there matched Problem One and was really meant to be a stashbuster. And oh boy, there is something so satisfying about using up random skeins of Sock/Fingering weight. 

The result? My absolute favorite beanie to wear, so fun and easy to make, and all the strands of stash held together makes for an immensely plush fabric. 
I’ll give myself a little pat on the back, for problems well-solved. 

I can almost guarantee you won’t make just one of these, so have fun experimenting with color! Marling colors together can be so much fun, and the end fabric can be surprising in all the best ways.

[Three Birds Yarn Studio][1]**

This worsted weight ‘Suzy Snowflake Beanie’ is knit in two-color stranded colorwork to create a festive wintery design. I used a third color for a contrasting brim. My inspiration for the name comes from my families’ favorite winter special: Suzy Snowflake. I think the snowflake motifs and color pairing resemble the style of this nostalgic stop motion cartoon from the early 1950’s. I have included written instructions for both the brim and decrease sections and a chart for the main fair isle portion. When choosing colors, I suggest using high contrasting colors to really show off the snowflakes.

**Gauge**
Using US 8 (5.0mm) needles:
21 sts and 25 rows make a 4” (10cm) square in stockinette stitch, unblocked, knit in the round.
20 sts and 23 rows make a 4” (10cm) square in main fair isle pattern, feel free to reference this gauge once the main portion of the hat is established.

We continue to be overwhelmed at the positive reception to our [Year of Hats][1] from 2019, and it was a no brainer to do it again in [Germantown Bulky][2]!

**Worthy of Note**
The Knox hat is worked in the round from the bottom up. The shell lace used in the pattern is a garter based stitch, and the pattern tends to elongate widthwise. As a result, stitches are decreased for the pattern after the brim is worked. Integrated decreases shape the crown, and as with all of our ""Year Of..."" patterns, a pom pom tops it off.

808507,2018 Winter Games Hat,Susan Rainey,3.71,24.0,4.0,single color stockinette,195.0,"I reverse engineered this hat from pictures I had seen showing the Team USA closing ceremonies hat, which others did as well!!

My hat is knit to a smaller gauge and has **5 repeats** of the diamond motif instead of 4 like other patterns.  Some people have used DK weight yarn very successfully.

I made this hat for my husband so he could wear it during the 2018 Birkebeiner Cross Country Ski Race in Hayward WI.  The race always coincides with the end of the Winter Olympic Games.  This year in particular is exciting because we have women cross country skiers in a position to do very well! 

I used basic worsted yarn in dark navy, bright red, and winter white/natural.  It is a bit slouchy - though not as slouchy as the hats made for the athletes!!

Some people have said the hat it too long - you can eliminate some of the plain navy rows after the ribbing to shorten your hat!!  The original hat is quite slouchy, so I already made it a bit shorter.  Row gauge may also be a factor.

I bought the flag patch at JoAnn Fabrics for about $2.

[Flag Patch][1]

[callaway12](/people/callaway12) used an even better patch that can be found [here][2].

**Pattern Note:** I originally designed this so the center front flag placement would be under a large diamond. My hubby, the hat recipient, wanted the flag under an X.  That is why the pictures of the hat are different - they show the two flag placements!

Keep cozy in style with Broadleaf Slouch, a charming brioche and stockinette hat designed to ward off the winter chill. Available in two sizes and featuring instructions for a slouch or beanie style, this versatile hat is knit in the round using mohair lace and fingering weight yarn (or sport weight) held together for a luxurious drape and extra warmth.

Choose two complementary colors from your stash to hold together for the stockinette body of the hat and the brioche background on the brim, then use a single strand of fingering/sport weight yarn for the foreground of the brioche in a contrasting color to make the gorgeous motif pop!

With its little yardage requirement, Broadleaf Slouch is the perfect stash-busting project! And if you're not a fan of mohair, no worries! You can still achieve a stunning result with Suri or Brushed Alpaca Silk by DROPS ($5/ball), or even DK yarn instead.

Don't let the brioche motif intimidate you! This pattern includes a step-by-step tutorial to help you tackle the technique with confidence. Broadleaf Slouch is a fun, fast, and engaging knit that will make you fall in love with brioche.

Mix and match weights and colors to make your Broadleaf Slouch truly unique! As long as you swatch and get gauge, you can work with either fingering or sport weight yarn, or both! Get creative and make a one-of-a-kind Broadleaf Slouch that you'll love to wear all winter long.

This design collection features an easy, mesmerizing stitch pattern that’s just as fun to look at as it is to knit up. It’s perfect for beginners who are comfortable knitting in the round. These hats will make wonderful stock for handmade markets or great gifts for anyone on your list! Please note that this pattern is for an adult size only, but you can easily adjust the stitch count and decrease section to make different sizes. Be sure to check out the other four patterns in the Vintage Peppermint Collection on Ravelry!!

The yarn I used for this pattern is [Stitch Please Worsted by Premier Yarns.][1] I’ve tried so many wool yarns over the years, and they’re often scratchy and uncomfortable to wear. Not this one! It’s 100% wool, yet it feels soft and luxurious to the touch, and it comes in so many beautiful colors to choose from! The best part is that it’s extremely affordable to fit any budget. Give it a try, you’ll love it!


***MATERIALS***

* Approximately 150 yards of C1 and 110 yards of C2 in a worsted weight (4) yarn. I used [Stitch Please Worsted by Premier Yarns][2] in ""Cherry Nice"" for C1 and ""Oat of This World"" for C2.

* US size 8 (5mm) 16"" circular knitting needles.

* US size * (5mm) double-pointed needles (optional).

* Faux fur pom pom (optional) - I get mine from BrennaAnnHandmade on Etsy!

* Common notions, such as stitch markers, measuring tape, yarn needle, and scissors.


***MEASUREMENTS***

Approximately 9.5” tall with brim folded up and 17” around (don’t worry, it’s stretchy and should fit most adults!)


***GAUGE***

12 sts x 14 rows = 2” in 1x1 ribbing

The pattern is 5 pages long with the chart/written directions on separate pages for each size. For printing purposes - all sizes need the first 2 pages and then Size S needs page 3, Size M page 4, Size L page 5. The pattern has been professionally tech edited and fully test knit to be clear and free of errors.

Also, I made the hat on size US 4 needles on this 2nd go around today and I've decided size US 4 makes a cap which too small and too snug.  As noted in the pattern, the 1st cap was made on size US 6 needles and this yields a comfy, loose fitting cap. If you are looking for a somewhat snugger cap, I recommend using size US 5 needles.

I designed this hat as a follow up to my bulky weight ‘waves beanie’ pattern. This super bulky weight, cabled beanie is a fairly quick project to work up. And, it is also very beginner friendly for anyone learning to cable knit. The texture comes from only left-leaning cable crosses which are staggered to create a waves effect.

Included with this pattern are instructions in both written and chart form depending of your preference.

**Gauge** 
Using US 15 (10.0mm) needles:
9 sts and 12 rows make a 4” (10cm) square in stockinette stitch, unblocked

Description:
Worked in the round on circular needles, pattern is for a one-size fits all Teen/Adult beanie in three weights--worsted, light bulky and bulky. The trellis stitch design can be worked up in one or two colors, even lending itself well to using up partial skeins. It's a great stash buster! The design has a single brim with careful attention to detail in the transition from brim to body, as well as concluding with a beautiful crown that shines with or without a pompom.

Pattern is in US terms using knit, purl, slip stitch, left and right cross stitches. It includes tables, charts and links to video tutorials for an easy to follow format and clear instructions. Reading pattern throughly before beginning is recommended.  

Adult beanie fits approximately 18-22"" head circumference.
Using recommended yarn will allow hat to stretch comfortably.

Skill level:
Intermediate pattern suitable for knitters with some experience. Knitting up in one color is recommended before trying a dual color hat, unless already experienced with strand work.

PRINTING NOTE: This is a checklist pattern; it is not necessary to print the entire pattern if you prefer not to use the 
checkboxes for each section. 

This is the companion piece to the Best Bobber Hat that I designed for a child of parents who run a resort in Northern Minnesota. The hat turned out so cute, that I decided to design a hat full of buttons for kids to display their favorites.

7293559,Rue Bonnie Hat,Caitlin Johnson,0.0,19.0,4.0,colorwork chart,200.0,"Find the matching Rue Bonnie Cowl pattern [here][1]!

The Rue Bonnie Hat is designed to be a fun and quick colorwork hat. This pattern includes 5 sizes (Infant, Child Small, Child Large, Adult Small, Adult Large) and two style options (a short-brim beanie and a longer folded-brim hat). A companion pattern to the Rue Bonnie Cowl, this design uses 1-2 skeins of Rauma Fivel and 35 grams or less of Junction Fiber Mill Making Tracks. If you’ve already knit the Rue Bonnie Cowl, your leftover Making Tracks will be great to use in the hat! 

This pattern has simple techniques for those who are new to colorwork. The colorwork calls for only two colors per row, and the small motifs means catching floats isn’t necessary.

The Woolly Thistle has kits available for the Rue Bonnie Hat and Cowl! Kits include enough yarn for both accessories, plus both of the pattern downloads, a TWT tote, and stitch marker! You can find those [here][2].

*""A unique cable pattern brings epic texture to your hat collection! This allover honeycomb stitch is interwoven with columns of textural tuck stitches throughout for a rhythmic, undulating fabric that is exceptionally squishy. An offset-ribbed brim flows seamlessly into the cable pattern, which continues unbroken into a floret-shaped crown design, giving the hat an artful cohesion throughout.""* — designer, Jared Flood

*Please note: the stitch patterns used for this accessory include written as well as charted instructions.*

----------------------------------------

**Construction**

* The hat is worked circularly from the bottom up, beginning with a ribbed brim worked on a needle 3-4 sizes smaller than your main needle. Going down several needle sizes this way improves the fit of this hat and creates a sturdy ribbed brim, from which the cables will emerge in an unbroken pattern.
* After completion of the ribbed brim, you will switch to main needle and work an increase round. The increased number of stitches is necessary to provide the proper ease for the cable patterning within the body of the hat.
* After completion of the unshaped portion of the hat body, crown shaping is worked to close the top of the hat. The decreases have been designed to integrate invisibly into the cable pattern, maintaining an unbroken look throughout the entire project.

**Finished Dimensions**

* 20½""/52 cm circumference, unstretched
* 8¼""/21 cm length
* To fit head sizes: 20-23”/51-58.5 cm

Pick any two colors of fingering weight yarn. The sample uses leftovers from my Half and Half Triangles Wrap.

Hold a self-striping yarn double for a different striping effect. For the second sample, I pulled one strand from the inside and one from the outside of a center-pull ball. You could get a completely different effect if you split the yarn into two balls and had both strands going in the same direction.

Hold any combination of yarns that amount to a DK-weight. The third sample is is one strand of fingering and two strands of lace.

<hr><hr><hr>

In the summer of 2022, I realized that maintaining a back catalog of hundreds of patterns was kind of overwhelming. I couldn’t do it and still release new things. So I took my old patterns down so I could keep doing new work. 

Since then, a handful of my favorites have [come back][11], and lovely new things have [come out][12]. But *the vast majority of the old patterns are retired and will no longer be generally available*.

***However, enough folks have asked about some old favorites that I’m planning to make many of the retired patterns available for a few days once or twice a year (most likely in late spring and then again in the fall around Thanksgiving).***

**Circumvolute** verb *to wind or turn, especially in an inward spiral*

You know that skein of speckled yarn in your stash?  The one that called your name and told you stories of all the fun times you'd have together and convinced you it just *had* to come live with you?  And then once you got it home it changed its tune and resolutely declined to swatch up nicely?  Yeah.  This pattern is for that skein.

I've found that speckled yarns behave best when you give them plenty of stockinette to play with.  But I don't care how pretty a yarn is, I'm still not inclined to knit a whole hat in stockinette.  So I've struck a little compromise here and worked in some slip stitch cables.  I think they actually show off the speckles even better than the stockinette (something about the elongated stitches you get when you slip shows off the little pops of color beautifully).  

It feels like the perfect compromise between letting the yarn take center stage and still reminding it you're in charge!  

Oh and just because someone will ask, of course you don't *have* to use speckled yarn.  It will look great with most anything you care to use.  I just found it did a great job of getting my recalcitrant speckles to behave! 

<hr><hr><hr>

The pattern includes the directions for both hats.  They're written in three or four sizes (three for the zig zag one, four for the one with straight lines), and you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the pieces. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a fabric you like with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 5.25, 5.5, 5.75, or 6 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for your size. With that range of sizes and gauges, the hats will fit a head between 19 and 25.5 inches (with *lots* of points in between). You can almost certainly make any size hat with less than 250 yards of yarn.

In the summer of 2022, I realized that maintaining a back catalog of hundreds of patterns was kind of overwhelming. I couldn’t do it and still release new things. So I took my old patterns down so I could keep doing new work. 

Since then, a handful of my favorites have [come back][11], and lovely new things have [come out][12]. But *the vast majority of the old patterns are retired and will no longer be generally available*.

***However, enough folks have asked about some old favorites that I’m planning to make many of the retired patterns available for a few days once or twice a year (most likely in late spring and then again in the fall around Thanksgiving).***

This is one of the patterns in *[Firmament: Stellar Stitches for your Next Adventure][2]*.

The book has lots of fun extras including:

* A detailed guide to the stitches used in the patterns plus info on how to start developing your own variations on them
* A mini stitch dictionary with alternate versions of the stitches used in the hats
* All the info you need to turn any of the hat patterns into cowl patterns
* A quick guide to everything I wish you knew about hats
* A quick primer on reading charts 

<hr><hr><hr>

Sometimes simple and classic is the way to go. And it doesn’t get much more simple or classic than a lovely ribbed hat. But charming though the classics may be, I like a little something extra to keep it interesting. And this beautiful stitch is just the thing!

Now don’t worry, I promise it’s not hard. I know it might look a bit daunting, but most of the time you’re just working nice, soothing ribbing. Every now and then you do a little something special to make a bit of magic. But even then, it’s easier than it looks (and I’ve even got some lovely illustrations to walk you through it step by step).

And the fabric you’ll create is just delightful. It’s extra thick (which means your hat will be super warm and cozy). And it looks beautiful on either side. I suspect you’re going to love it (and might just find yourself using this stitch on other projects)!

<hr><hr><hr>

The hat is written in five sizes (castons of 104, 112, 120, 128, and 136 stitches), and you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the hat. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a fabric you like with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 5.5, 6, 6.5, or 7 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for your size. With that range of sizes and gauges, the hat will fit a head between 18.75 and 24 inches (with *lots* of points in between).

<hr><hr><hr>

**This is perfect for you if:**
* You really need to know how that stitch works
* You love the idea of a reversible hat
* You're looking for a lovely, meditative project
 
**It's** ***not*** **for you if:**

* You don't like charts (the pattern uses charts)
* You hate swatching (you need to swatch to check your needle size)

The Hats for Sailors group provides hand-knit and hand-crochet hats for Navy and Coast Guard personnel one ship at a time.  The group wanted quick and easy patterns to encourage new knitters or knitters who are picking up the craft again after a hiatius.
  
At times everyone wants an easy-peasy basic hat project that can be worked on anywhere  … something that can be picked up while relaxing with a favorite tv show, sitting in a waiting room or riding along on a road trip.

No Purls 4 Sailors is nice and stretchy and very forgiving in size.  If you're knitting for charity or unsure of the size for someone in your life, this hat would be a good choice.  The wearer can adjust the fit by rolling the bottom edge up or down.   And it's also a good way to use up leftover yarn to make a one-of-a-kind hat.

The face details are worked after the hat is completed with the embroidery chain stitch. Easy peasy!

**Yarn:** 80 (100, 120, 140, 160) yards/75 (90, 110, 130, 150) meters of DK weight yarn and scrap amounts of a contrast color yarn in a similar weight. 
Sample shown in Sirdar Simply Recycled colorway 0021. 

**Needles:** Size US 7/4.5 mm and size US 6/4 mm circular needles with a long (40”/100 cm) cable or double-point needles, for preferred working in the round method, or size needed to obtain gauge and one size smaller.

Slipstitch (also known as Mosaic Knitting) is when you only work certain stitches on each row or round, then with your second color, work those same slipped stitches on the following round. This gives a Fair Isle look without having to worry about tension, still creating a warm and lofty piece.

I chose to work Oscilla in six of our Minikins in coordinating, but contrasting, colors. Optionally, you could pick just two colors to show the full, unbroken gradients!

In order to create the textured pattern, every 10th row the ribbing switches from K1P1 to P1K1 (and then back to K1P1 after another 10 rows).  This is great practice for early knitters who hate doing ribbing (I was there once).  

As written the pattern will create a stretchy hat with a long brim.  If you prefer a hat without a brim or a shorter brim there are alternative options included with the pattern.  

This hat will fit most adult heads because of the stretch.  You'll need about 250y of worsted weight yarn to make the longer version of the hat and 150y for the shorter version.

I love creating simple designs because sometimes it's just so nice to relax with a fun easy knit while watching your favorite show or listening to your favorite music. 

Once again I named my hat after my daughter's drawing. She created a sheep-like animal in her ongoing story that she's been writing and illustrating. (See pics) Super Cute. She pronounces it ""weh-kah"".

Skill level: Beginner

The Stash Happy Hat is a stash-busting, easy-knitting, head-warming, quick-to-knit hat. The hat is sized for baby through large adult. Each hat is unique, as two strands of fingering weight are held together to create a one-of-a-kind striped marled colorway in each hat. Stash dive and use coordinating leftovers from socks and shawls or grab a fingering mini-skein set from your Local Yarn Shop and play with twirling the colors together in fantastic color combinations. 

*Construction Details:* 
The Scrap Happy Hat is worked in the round from the brim towards the crown using two strands of fingering weight yarn held together. Smaller needles are used for the ribbed brim and the larger needles are used for the body and crown.

* [Joining in the round][2]
* Knit/Purl
* Decreasing (k2tog) 
* [Working with DPN][3] (or preferred small circumference knitting technique)

1315515,Short Staple Beanie,Jeanette Godreau,2.4,,4.0,Stockinette in the round,225.0,"The Short Staple Beanie is a knitted beanie that is customizable to your unique head measurements! This beanie has recommendations for fitting above or over the ears, but you can really make it as short or as long as you want. It will fit everyone’s head like a dream, and the simple design will make it a staple for cold and breezy days, or whenever you wanna wear a cute beanie!

**Yarn:**
You can use any weight and any size yarn for this pattern! However, I highly recommend using fingering through worsted yet yarn for the best results.

The recommended yarn for this pattern is [Everyday Merino by Twice Sheared Sheep][1] (affiliate link)!

**Amount of yarn needed:**
The amount of yarn you need depends on what kind of yarn you use and your measurements. Average yardages needed per weight of yarn for an adult-sized beanie is listed below for your reference:
* Fingering: 300-375 yards 
* Sport: 250-350 yards 
* DK: 130-250 yards
* Worsted: 125-225 yards

**Materials:**
* Stitch Markers (4 in one color/design and 1 in another)
* Tapestry Needle
* Scissors
* Measuring Tape

**Gauge:** 
You can use any gauge! However, it is very important that you gauge swatch and determine your gauge before working this pattern in order to determine how many sts and rows you need to work throughout this pattern to get the exact right fit.

**Needles:** 
You can use any size needles for this pattern. I recommend using a needle size that creates a nice fabric with the yarn you’ve chosen to work with. Once you determine your main needle size, you will also need one set of needles a size smaller for working the folded brim. Sizing down your needles for the brim will help make it more fitted.

In terms of types of needles, you need:
* 16” circular needles
* double pointed needles (DPNs) OR 36”+ circular needles to use with the magic loop method

**Techniques needed** (step-by-step instructions AND video references are included for each technique):

* Calculating math (adding, subtraction, division, and multiplication). I walk you through each step! If you are not a math fan, I also include a link to a Google Sheet that has all of the formulas ready for you. All you have to do is add your measurements and the math is done automatically!
* Stockinette in the round
* Decreases
* Folding a brim

Every year during the [Chicago Yarn Crawl][3], we highlight a yarn company that exemplifies who we are and what we believe at String Theory. This year, we want you to take a closer look at earth-friendly Laneras.

Their commitment to sustainability goes beyond the source of their wool. For example, in the factory where the wool is processed, the water they use is collected rainwater. All liquid and solid effluents are treated to meet the highest standards and are re-used onsite. In fact, this factory was recently evaluated as carbon-negative, which means they are removing more carbon from the environment than they are producing. 

You will need two contrasting skeins of yarn. With two 100g skeins, there will be enough to make two hats if you switch the Main Color and the Contrast Color for the second one. 

The pattern includes links to my favorite tutorials for a folded hem and helical stripes. I've also included an option to skip the folded hem, but I strongly encourage you to try it and potentially learn something new.

The design is achieved with a series of left and right twist stitches, and no cable needle is needed. It is suitable for an advanced beanie on up in knitting skills.

There are so many wonderful yarns, including some amazing indie dyed yarns. Super Bulky and Light Super Bulky yarns can vary a bit in their thickness, this combined with different knitting gauges can sometimes be a challenge. In this pattern there are varied cast on options to find a great fit for you and your yarn.

**Super Bulky** patterns have a cast on options  of 44 and 48. The pattern is written using US 11/ 8mm and US 13 / 9mm needles (brim / body), but it a knitter is wanting a slightly larger size or is a tight knitters, the needles can be sized up to US 13/ 9mm and US 15/ 10mm. Yarn examples: Malabrigo Rasta, Baah Mammoth, Dream in Color Savvy.

**Light Super Bulky** patterns have a cast on option of 52 and 54 stitches. These utilize US 10.5 / 6.5mm and US 11 / 8mm needles, and like in the super bulky, the needles can be sized up to US 11/ 8mm and US 13 / 9mm. Yarn examples: Malabrigo Noventa, Madelinetosh ASAP, and Baah Sequoia.

The four patterns within this pattern have a very similar look, the pattern repeat is slightly different in each, the crowns of each pattern also vary slightly but all have a defined pattern and gradual decrease for an excellent fit.

The pattern has been tested by numerous knitting testers, it is clear and easy to follow with directions and plenty of images. The pattern itself is numerous pages to include as much detail and clarity as possible. 

In the testing process a number of different super bulky and light super bulky yarns were used. The over yardage on the beanie is less than many in part due to the gradual decrease. For images beyond those shown on Ravelry, it is suggested to look on Instragram under #brokentopbeanie to view an extensive gallery.

Worked in the round on circular needles, pattern includes instructions for four sizes (infant, child, teen/adult, large adult) and with a choice of single or folded brims. Using knit, purl, left and right purl crosses, and front and back cable stitches, this beanie requires some concentration but is so worth the effort. Charts, tables, video links and written instructions are included and provide clarity and an easy-to-use format. Pattern is written in US terms.

Beanie looks great with or without a pompom because of the careful detail in the crown, making it a perfect gender-neutral hat. The final result is a classic, modern take on traditional cables, creating an intricate hat that will appeal to just about everyone! It makes the perfect gift, but don't forget to make one for yourself too!

As soon as I saw this creamy, gorgeous yarn I wanted to create a feminine, cozy cabled hat with a deep folded brim. The subtle halo from the alpaca is just gorgeous here and really makes for a an eye catching accessory when paired with your coat this winter. 

The medallions are elegant and textured and flow beautifully into the ribbing both at brim and crown, and shaping is centered above each medallion, worked to highlight the ribbed pattern as you approach the top.  The brim is deep and easily adjustable and adds to the cozy feel of the hat. 

Notes are included in the pattern regarding modifications for circumference and depth and cable instructions are both charted and written. 


**Sizing:**
15(18,21)”/38(45.75,53.5)cm circumference laid flat. 
Hat stretches 1-2”/2.5-5cm when worn. 
10.5(11.5,11.5)”/26.75(28.75,28.75)cm deep to center crown, unfolded.  


**Yardage needed:**
200(230,260)yds
183(210,240)m 

A light, soft DK-weight yarn needed, or a fingering plus mohair to get gauge.  I designed this hat to show off a gorgeous halo, but you could also work this in a more traditional light worsted or round DK that works up to the gauge needed. I suggest using a subtle colorway without a lot of shifts in tone, as the detail in the medallions would be lost in a busy yarn. Exact yardage may vary with modifications or substitute yarn. 

Please note that two skeins of Som DK are needed for all 3 sizes.

This beautifully textured cabled and bobbled beanie is a fun and engaging knit that's easier than it looks. Worked in the round from the bottom up on circular needles, pattern is written in US terms for 4 weights, resulting in a gorgeous one-size-fits-most teen/adult beanie. Using only knit, purl, a simple wrapped bobble technique, and left and right purl cross stitches, this beanie knits up quickly, especially with bulky and super bulky yarn. Short on time? It's the perfect candidate for that quick weekend project! It's also the perfect candidate for market prep where time is money. Not to mention, it results in a gorgeous, squishy hat with loads of appealing texture that people will want to reach out and touch! It truly is irresistible!

Pattern is written in US terms for worsted, light bulky, bulky and super bulky weight yarn. It includes a stitch chart for visual knitters and written instructions for those who prefer the written word. Video tutorials are also included for the specialty stitches, taking any guess-work out of the equation. Beanie looks great with or without a pompom because of the careful detail in the crown, which also makes it perfect for any gender. 

One size fits most teen-adults. Beanie fits approximately 18-22"" head circumference.

Skill level:
Moderate skill level. Suitable for knitters with only a little experience, including knitters new to cables. The bulkier the yarn, the less cables in the pattern. Never knit purl cross cables before? Begin with the super bulky version--you will have them down in no time at all.

7332360,Outdoorable,Melissa Kemmerer,0.0,32.0,4.0,corrugated ribbing,310.0,"Introducing Outdoorable!

Outdoorable is a sport weight hat featuring two colors worked in corrugated ribbing. One color is used for all the knit stitches, while the second color is used for all the purl stitches. Crown decreases are cleverly worked to maintain the striped ribbing all the way to the top.

I paired Spincycle Dyed in the Wool with Natural Syster by Beautiful Syster, and I love the mix of sophisticated plied colors with a sturdy rustic solid. 

The purl stitches are larger than the knit stitches and will therefore ""pop,"" even when the purled yarn is slightly lighter weight than the knitted yarn, as it is here.

There are charts for both a sport weight hat and mittens, as well as multiple charts for fingering weight hats and mittens.

These charts, particular for the hats, have been extensively tested by Ravelry members. They have tried all sorts of variations, using yarn up to worsted weight in thickness, lengths from beanie to slouchy, and have even double knit the pattern. The pattern includes a wide range of optional elements, such as Latvian braids and Estonian two-colour cast ons (Kinhi cast on). For these options, there is either instruction or links to Internet reference materials.

**Notes**
Swatch both St st and Stranded St st since gauge may differ; adjust needle as needed.

To adjust hat depth, work more or fewer ribbing and/or St st rnds before and after the Colorwork Chart.

If using a different needle size or an alternate yarn, the ribbed brim should be worked on a needle one size smaller than the size used for the St st sections to ensure a snug fit around the brim.

**ABOUT THE PATTERN**

This is a **fun, quick knit** that creates a warm, cozy, gender-neutral, plain knit hat that is the **perfect winter hat** and a **simple and easy gift knit**. This pattern includes written and charted instructions. 

 I recommend knitting the size that provides 1-2 inches / 2.5-5 cm of negative ease in the circumference.  This pattern includes sizes newborn to large adult and is easily adaptable for a sizing of your choice.  If you wish for a beanie style, knit a height similar to the recipient’s measurement; for a slouchy style, add additional length prior to decreasing.  

When you purchase this pattern, you will receive **two PDF files: one with the written instructions and one with the charted instructions**.  This makes it easy for you to navigate your preferred instruction type.  If you are working the charted version, be sure to just print the pages for the size you're working, so you can save on ink and paper!

[BrioComfort Hat kits][5]

**Skill level:** Beginner Brioche friendly!!!  Knitting one-color and two-color brioche in the round is a fantastic way to learn the technique and teach your hands the muscle memory of brioche knitting.  Techniques used: knit, purl, knitting decreases, brioche knit (brk), brioche purl (brp), knitting in the round, Long Tail Tubular Cast On. 

**Construction Notes:** This hat is knit completely in the round starting at the bottom of the brim and worked up to the top of the crown. You will begin with the Long Tail Tubular Cast On, which creates a beautifully machine-made look and is perfect for 1x1 ribbing, of which the brim is made. You will set up your hat with this large brim before moving on to One-Color Brioche.  One-Color Brioche in the round is a fantastic way to learn, and is a great transition to Two-Color Brioche because you are brioche knitting AND brioche purling your stitches. After working One-Color Brioche briefly, you will work the remainder of the Hat Body using Two-Color Brioche. This is where it gets fascinating. Seeing the way the two colors work together to create this double-sided fabric is where the true magic of brioche knitting lies.  You can better see the anatomy of the stitches, and knitting it in the round is a simpler way to learn because you are doing the same thing with each color yarn every time you work with it. When you reach the crown shaping, you will end your brioche knitting and finish up your hat with simple knit stitches and decreases.

After blocking the hat fits well as a snug beanie, and has a circumference of roughly 22 inches. 

Some people may feel that it is a bit tight and may benefit from using a different gauge of needles or yarn weight. The same applies to the overall length of the hat, and some may prefer to extend the brim or do an extra repeat of the body pattern if they want it to cover the ears.

The body is worked from written instructions, and the crown is worked from a chart. The knit is straightforward and a good introduction to both cable knitting and reading charts.

Hyalite Canyon is a favorite destination  for the climbers in my family. The image of bulky ropes against rough cliffs was the inspiration for this design. The interesting twisted stitch used here really makes the ropes pop off the background - no cabling required. Knit with just one skein of super soft Malabrigo Rios, with a folded or single layer brim, you can knit one for climbers and acrophobes alike!

This design is appropriate for knitters with some experience knitting hats in the round. Written directions are given for working the twisted stitch, as well as a link to a helpful video I made. The pattern is 3 pages long and has been fully test knit and professionally tech edited to be clear and free of errors.

**Sizes:**
S/M (M/L) to fit head circumferences of 20 - 22 (21 - 23) in/ 51 - 56 (53.5 - 58.5) cm. Both sizes are very stretchy to fit a wide variety of head sizes.

**Finished Measurements:**
Circumference unstretched: 17.25 (19.5) in/ 44 (49.5) cm. 
Height: 8 1/2 (9) in/ 21.5 (23) cm. 

**Gauge:**
Gauge over stockinette stitch swatch knit flat: 25 st and 28 rows/ 4in/ 10 cm.
Gauge over pattern in round: Approximately 26 sts and 30 rnds/ 4 in/ 10 cm - this can be difficult to measure, so choose your needle size based on your stockinette swatch.

**What You Need:**

* Malabrigo Rios (Merino superwash; 210 yds/ 192 m per 3.5 oz/100g skein); 1 (1) skein OR 140 (165) yds/ 127 (150) m for single brim version and 175 (205) yds/ 159 (187) m for folded brim version of a similar worsted weight yarn.
  
* **Gauge Size Needles:** 16 in/ 40 cm long circular needle and one set of dpns i**n size required to obtain gauge**. I used US #5/ 3.75 mm. You may need a size or two above or below that.
  
* **Smaller than Gauge Size Needle:**
16 in/ 40 cm long circular needle 1 or 2 US sizes smaller than Gauge Size Needle depending on how snug you want your hat to fit. (Smaller needle gives a  snugger fit.)
I used  US #3/ 3.25 cm for both samples. 
  
* 1 stitch marker
 
* optional: 7 (8) clip on markers
  
* tapestry needle 
  
* optional: faux fur pom-pom or topper of your choice.

Inside Hat gives you lightweight warmth and the coziness you crave in damp weather, but is lightweight enough to wear all day, including when you're - you know, inside  
Perfect for that transitional weather when winter is turning into spring or autumn into winter. You can leave this hat on as you are doing errands or going in and out of the house and keep the chill off without getting hot. 

Instructions are included for working flat or in the round, whichever you prefer, and there is sizing for kids and adults.

**Difficulty**: Adventurous beginner. 
Stitches used in this pattern:  knit, purl, k2tog, p2tog, and working a 4-stitch cable (explained in pattern). 

**Sizes**: Child (teen/adult S, adult M/L, adult XL) to fit head circumference of approximately 18 (20, 22, 24)""/45 (50, 55, 60) cm 

**Gauge:**  28 sts and 36 rounds to 4""/10 cm in stockinette stitch before blocking; 48 sts and 40 rounds to 4""/10 cm in pattern after blocking. Note that this is a very stretchy hat.

**Yarn:** Fingering/sock yarn, approximately 35 (40, 45, 50) grams/120 (150, 175, 200) yards/115 (140, 160, 185) meters. 

**Needles:**  US 3/3.25 mm or size to obtain gauge. 
If you are working in the round: A 16""/40 cm circular needle will be comfortable for all but the child size, which will need to be worked either on a 12""/30 cm circular needle, double-pointed needles or a much longer circular needle, if you prefer the Magic Loop method. All sizes will need dpns/Magic Loop as the number of stitches decreases at the crown of the hat.

**Notions:** If you are working in the round: Marker for beginning of round + 6 (7, 8, 9) additional markers.  If working flat, you will not need the BOR marker. Small loops of yarn can be used if you do not have enough markers. You will also need a tapestry needle for weaving in ends, and, if working flat, for seaming.

**Just in case**: If you have questions as you go, my email is in the pattern.

This may sound complicated but I promise it isn’t (but this should NOT be your first attempt at Fair Isle - if you’re looking for a newbie pattern check out my Appalachian Trail Hat or my Welling Court Hat)  What this means is you **need to read the pattern before getting started!**

The pattern is available as a written or charted pattern (but after you’ve done the first two or three color changes you’ll have it down pat).

As written the pattern uses 4 contrasting colors and each color is used 3 times for a total of 12 possible colors. There is a lot of possibility for stash busting and creative color use.

A gansey inspired hat with simple but very effective knit and purl patterning. The neat brim is worked in garter stitch at a tight gauge with short row shaping so that it’s longer over the ears — a minimalist approach to ear flaps. The crown is softly gathered with rapid decreases and joined with a 3-needle-bind-off worked from the inside. This creates a tidy seam detail more often found on ready to wear.

Anyone who knits socks has a supply of leftover yarn and orphan skeins and you don’t know quite how to use them all up. This is a simple unisex hat pattern that uses the leftovers and orphan skeins of sock yarn for a uniquely colored hat.  Use two strands at a time and when you finish one ball, simply pick up another one. You can use orphan skeins as a main color and keep changing the leftover yarns as you work up the hat.  Pretty soon your scrap sock yarn is used up and you can justify purchasing new sock yarn! 

My pattern is similar to the original LOSY Hat pattern in that it uses leftover sock yarn. This is just another hat pattern to use your leftover and orphan sock yarn.

I always look at the array of colors Candice has and mentally pair different combos up when I see them, and these two colors just jumped out at me. Plus, you know how I feel about a soft, rustic Rambouillet.  It may be one of my favorite fibers ever - it's round and squishy, with enough memory for a great fit, plus it's soft enough for next-to-skin wear.  

I decided to design two hats that definitely go together, but don't feel matched.  The use of reverse colors, sharp angles in both chevrons and diamonds, and a liberal smattering of small dots keep these two designs feeling like cousins, but they are actually very different - and both are super quick and fun to make.

Pattern contains instructions for both hats. 

Sizes will fit an older child to an adult. Notes on modifying hats for depth or width are included, and colorwork is charted in the pattern. 

If substituting yarn, note that Pishkun is a heavy DK. You could use another heavy DK weight yarn or a light worsted weight yarn to get gauge. Choose colors that will allow the pattern to show up when knit, and make sure your fiber has enough memory for a well - fitting hat.

The Glass Ceiling Hat is a DK weight beanie that features a simple textured pattern that's easy memorize once you get going. It results in a very versatile, wearable hat perfect for your male, female or non-binary loved ones. The ribbed effect of the stitch pattern makes for a very stretchy hat, making it great for a gift.

This pattern has been **tech edited & test knit** so you can knit on with confidence, but if you ever have any questions, don't hesitate to message me. Pattern also contains a link to a **video tutorial** that shows how to do the slipped stitch technique used in this pattern.

The ribbed effect of the fabric is very stretchy. If you are at the lower end of the head circumference range listed, you could consider going down to a smaller size if you like a fitted hat though, please note, it may affect how wide that ribbing stretches out.

- Size 3 Sample used 54g, 132 yards / 120 meters

**About the Name**

The Glass Ceiling Hat takes its name from the [Legacy Fiber Artz][1] yarn with a colorway of the same name. The yarn was introduced in January 2021 and described by the dyers as “a colorway that celebrates the women behind the gorgeous fashion at this year’s historic inauguration.” 
The slipped stitches in this pattern remind me of ladders, and while the traditional corporate ladder held little promise for women and minorities, I am hopeful for continued change both in the US and around the world. I encourage you to put your energy, hope and attention into each stitch of this hat and into each day moving forward. Our collective energy and attention can and will change the world—one stitch, one step, one change at a time.

**SKILLS**
—
This is a written pattern assuming foundational knitting knowledge and is not intended to be beginner friendly. Supplemental research or practice to learn new skills may be required to complete this project.

This pattern requires a working knowledge of: knitting & purling in the round, increasing, decreasing, basic sewing.

DPNs are used to work in the round for the cast-on, then switching to circular needles for the main body of the hat. As the crown takes shape, DPNs are used again as the sts decrease. Finally, the ends of the hat are sewn together.

There are 2 cast-on methods included in this pattern for an easier cast on and an intermediate form fitted cast on with DPNs.",5.0,16,22,4.33,"0-3m, 3-6m, 6-12m, Toddler, Child, Youth, Adult, Adult L",Any gauge

This...this isn’t a normal pattern. It’s not instructions for how to make one specific thing. Or rather, it’s not *only* instructions for how to make one specific thing (don’t worry, I will totally tell you exactly how to make those hats). Instead it’s more like a bag of blocks—a whole bunch of pieces you can stack up in lots of different ways to make all sorts of things!

You see, I’ve come to realize that the thing that makes me really love a pattern is having all the bits and pieces of whatever I’m making flow nicely into each other. Now, exactly what that means will be different from pattern to pattern! On a sock it might mean having the heel and toe line up just so with the pattern on the leg and foot. On a hat, it might mean having the crown grow smoothly out of the body. The details will be different every time, but keeping elements from the main stitch pattern going throughout the whole thing and having everything transition organically between sections is what makes it all just click in my brain.

That usually means I end up coming up with a whole bunch of little pieces as I work on a design. And then I stack those pieces up to make whatever I want (hat, socks, cowl, mitts, shawl, whatever tickles my fancy that day). Because once you have the pieces, mixing them together to make something is easy!

So what I’ve done here is take the main stitch pattern from one of my sock patterns ([Popped][3]) and charted out all the pieces you might need to take that stitch pattern and use it in all sorts of other things. In this case, that’s an initial rib, a way to transition from the initial rib into the main stitch pattern, the main stitch pattern, two different ways to transition from the main stitch pattern back out a final rib, and final rib. I’ve charted each of those out, both flat and in the round, for four different widths (a main stitch pattern 16, 18, 20, and 22 stitches wide), then I added a couple of increase and decrease options for things like thumb gussets or hat crowns. And now you can take those pieces and put them together to make whatever you want (don’t worry, I also included a couple of sizing guides for hats and socks and mitts to help get you started).

I’ve put the pieces together to make two different hats, just to show you an example of what you can do. But you could absolutely turn these into mitts or a cowl or socks or whatever else you can dream up. I can’t wait to see what you you create!

<hr>

**General information**

Think of this more like a bag of blocks! It's a whole bunch of pieces (more than 70 different charts) you can stack up to make all sorts of things, rather than a specific pattern.  Now don't worry, I do tell you exactly how to make both of the hats you see in the pictures! But I do that as a starting point, as an example of how you might put the pieces together. My real intent is that you'll rearrange the pieces to make pretty much whatever you want!

**Skills & scope**

If you're just making the hats, this is all very chill. It's just a bit of fancy, swoopy ribbing and some pretty little increases and decreases, all worked in the round, nice and mellow. If you decide you want to venture off on your own and try something new, your imagination is the limit and you can do whatever you want!

The pattern uses [charts][4], so you will need to know how to follow a knitting chart.

**Yarn, gauge & sizing**

Because this is a bit different than your usual pattern, it's a bit tricky to talk about gauge and sizing. If you're making the hats in the pictures, you've got more than a dozen different size options and ten different gauges to pick from. That means you can use just about any weight of yarn from fingering up through worsted, and there will be a size to fit pretty much anyone’s head.

And if you decide to make something all your own, I've included sizing guides for hats, mitts, and socks that will show you what size head or hand or feet those projects will fit at a whole host of stitch counts and gauges to help get you started.

The hats in the pictures took about 125 yards of super bulky-weight yarn. If you’re working with thinner yarn, 250 yards is a safer bet.

**Tools & supplies**

If you're making the hats, you’ll need needles that let you work in the round (circulars or DPNs) in whatever size lets you get a solid fabric with your chosen yarn plus the general knitting tools you need for most projects (scissors to cut your yarn, a darning needle to weave in ends, the occasional stitch marker or bit of scrap yarn to hold stitches). If you're making something of your own, you might need different things, but there's nothing about the stitch patterns themselves that would make you need anything unexpected.

I am constantly inspired by watching Nature’s colors change from season to season – seeing the rich, warm autumn colors fading to myriad shades of grey when Fall begets Winter is a particular favorite. I designed this hat with these seasonal color schemes in mind – each “Season” quite different from the next. The design comes in 4 sizes/styles and 4 colorways, so many versions can be made from the same pattern. Alternatively, a 2-color version can be worked by subbing HC, CC2 and CC4 with a single color, and CC1 and CC3 with a second color. Options are endless – one of my favorite things about knitting!

Knit in the round, with a very easy stitch pattern, this hat is a fun, quick project to make! There is only one end to weave in, and a jumbo pom-pom gives it that “awwwww!!!” factor. This hat was designed with no ease. To have a snug hat, go down a size. For slouchier, go up one size. Remember to knit to your original lengths, though!

**TIPS**
For those of you who purchased the first edition of the Hank Hat Kit (as a postcard), we accidentally omitted the special instructions for ""knit the next st tog tbl with the purl bump below"". So here ya go:
Using the tip of your left needle, insert from top and lift the purl bump onto that needle. Knit the next two sts together through the back loop. The purl bump you're aiming for is in the column of stitches 8 rounds under and directly below the next stitch.

Still confused? Check out this amazing [video][1], showing the technique!

**2 Hats in 1 Pattern!** 
Scottish Honeymoon was inspired by my own adventure, Winter Plaid and picnics in the snow.  This pattern includes His and Her complimenting hats, knit using beautiful yarns hand-dyed by Heather of [House of A La Mode][1]. His hat is the perfect blank slate to show off a fabulous variegated yarn, with interesting ribbing and purl ridges to add texture. Her hat was designed to make a speckled yarn shine, with slight ribbing, and purl and stockinette horizontal striping.  These make great holiday gifts!!

**Skill level:** Beginning knitter; techniques used include knitting, purling, knitting in the round, decreasing stitches.

**Sizes for both hats:** 
**Adult small:** 18” / 20.3cm circ. x 8 1/2” / 21.6cm height 
**Adult large:** 20” / 50.8cm circ. x 8 1/2” / 21.6cm height 
Measurements taken after blocking. Large size modeled for both styles on 23” (His) and 22” (Her) heads. His hat is meant to fit a bit more snuggly, while Her hat is a slouchier, feminine fit. 

**Gauge for both hats:**  22 sts x 32 rows = 4” / 10mm in stockinette stitch [taken after blocking]

Bold cables and garter stitch create a strong texture that's not lost in the fiber, and the contrast between the cable and background stitches made for a really striking transition into crown shaping. It's a super quick knit, and an easily memorized motif. 

The pattern also lends itself beautifully to either a slouch or to a brimmed, more fitted cap - and I think it works well on pretty much any gender as well.  

The design is named for the beer our friend Tom loves, and because he's the best kind of hat recipient, he's kept his version - adding it to his One Bourbon, which he wears everywhere. 

Cable pattern is both charted and written.

Sometimes the details of every day life take up so much time and energy that it can be difficult to see the bigger picture. When that happens it’s good to step back, take a deep breath, and do something a little out of the ordinary to help restore your perspective. Call a friend, read a new book, hike up a different trail, or maybe knit this hat. 

Made from worsted or aran weight yarn, this hat knits up quickly and is perfect for gifting—to yourself or to a loved one. The colorwork is good for beginners, but also makes great TV knitting for the more experienced. Sized from toddler to adult. 

**Materials**

Use any aran or worsted weight yarn that gives you gauge. You need less than 25g of your contrast color, so it's a great way to use up leftovers from other projects!

1230202,April Showers Beanie,RosiePosieKnitCo,2.33,20.0,4.0,Stockinette,160.0,"
Pattern Notes: 
	The April Showers Beanie is a simple stranded color work design using 5 colors of worsted (4) weight yarn. The best part about this pattern is that there are no long floats to worry about catching, so this is a great introduction to colorwork for a beginner. The pattern is written and charted in 5 sizes, from Baby to Adult. 
	As with any colorwork design, many folks tend to knitter tighter on the colorwork portion than in straight stockinette stitch. It is wise to make a colorwork swatch when checking your gauge. One great and simple way to combat tight tension is to go up a needle size or two when you get to the charted portion of the pattern. I also find that my tension is much more even when I do two-handed colorwork knitting. There are lots of video tutorials for how to use this technique on YouTube!

Techniques Required: 
•	Long Tail Cast On (or stretchy cast on of your choice)
•	Stranded colorwork in the round
•	Reading a knitting chart (Optional—pattern is also written)

1269843,Bulky Beginner's Hat,Maggie Billings,1.8,13.0,4.0,Stockinette,125.0,"This pattern is a bulky-weight version of my Basic Beginner's Hat pattern used for my knitting classes. The benefit of this version is that it works up much more quickly, making it easier to complete in less time than the worsted-weight version. 

This pattern is knit in the round with instructions for decreases and blocking. You will start with a 16"" circular needle and move on to double-pointed needles as the circumference decreases. Instructions are for an average adult-sized hat fitting a head about 21-23"" circumference. The bulky-weight yarn makes the hat slightly less stretchy than the worsted-weight version. 

Materials:
*Brown Sheep Lamb’s Pride Bulky (125 yds/114m, 4oz/113g, 85% wool 15% mohair): 1 skein
*US size 10 (6mm) circular knitting needles with a 16” cable, or size needed to obtain gauge.
*US size 10 (6mm) double-pointed needles, or size needed to obtain gauge.
* Stitch markers
* Measuring tape or ruler 
* Tapestry needle for weaving in ends

This can be knit in any bulky-weight yarn as long as it matches the pattern gauge. Lamb's Pride Bulky can be a good choice for beginners since it is single-ply and hard to split.

Without a doubt, monarchs are the most iconic butterfly in the United States. They are most famous for their annual migration, which takes place each spring and late summer/fall. Some journey as far as 3,000 miles to their winter homes in the south. The monarch motifs represent an attempt to capture these magnificent butterflies in flight, perhaps on their migratory trek across the continent.

*“The Foliage Dot hat employs a unique and interesting stitch pattern that reminds me of autumn leaves. Each “leaf” motif is similar to a bobble, in that several stitches are increased from a single stitch to create each textural leaf. Unlike a bobble, however, the decreasing of these additional stitches is distributed over the following few rounds, rather than being worked all at once.*

*This whimsical stitch pattern provides a great opportunity for creative colorplay. Experiment with incorporating 2, 3, 4 (or more) contrast colors to create unique color stories. Design your palette using Peerie mini skeins, or raid your yarn scraps to mix and match colors and fibers for a hat that is completely unique.”* — designer, Jared Flood

This stitch pattern can be played up or down depending on your yarn fiber and color choices. For example, a fuzzy alpaca yarn will make the texture much harder to detect, but a smooth tonal superwash yarn might allow the purl bumps to really shine.

7315389,Fun Faux Beanie,Sandra A James,0.0,8.0,4.0,stockinette in super bulky,88.0,"The Fun Faux Beanie pattern is a twist on the crocheted-to-look-like-knitted concept. This knitting pattern is knit-to-look-like-crochet and, I promise, you will look twice - that's the faux part! The fun part is all the possible color combinations you will make as you use up all those pesky, partial skeins and scraps taking up way too much room in your closet. Who doesn't want to turn them into something beautiful? And you get to do it with a choice of single or dual stripes, or a combination of both. Now that's a lot of possibilities!

Pattern is written for three weights in two sizes (teen/adult and adult), and is an easy cable knitting pattern in US terms (English). It is perfect for market prep because it absolutely flies off the needles. It is a super quick knit in the round and a fun way to use up all those annoying partial skeins and turn them into something useful.

Though written for super bulky, bulky and light bulky yarn, pattern easily lends itself to other weights and sizes with its simple four-stitch repeat over four rounds. Helpful tables, charts and video tutorials are included eliminating any guess-work. New to cabling? No problem. This simple 1/1 cable (RPC and LPC) is explained in a video tutorial and you'll even be shown how to do it without a cable needle. You will be amazed how easy it is! The end result is a beautifully, bulky beanie that is full of texture, quick to make, a pleasure to knit, superbly warm to wear, and best of all, made from scraps!

9802,Top-Down Ribbed Beanie,MK Carroll,2.35,,,,,"Looking for a basic beanie hat knit from the top down so you can custom fit the size and try it on as you go? You might like this one. 

This is more of a recipe than a pattern, so that you may use any yarn you like and work at any gauge you like.  This is a great pattern for handspuns!  Please note that if you were working from the recipe before July 2007 that there was an error in how to determine the circumference of the beanie, and that has now been corrected [should read ""measure across from side to side (not diagonally) and multiply by 4 to get the perimeter (which will become the circumference of the finished beanie)""].

Tip: try the [disappearing loop cast][1] on as described on the TECHknitting blog for a really clean looking beginning!

Tip: try the [Belly Button Start for Circular Knitting][2] by Rosemarie Buchanan if the beginning in the recipe is really fiddly for you.

<hr><hr><hr>

You know when you get an idea and you're having so much fun you just have to run with it?  Yeah, that totally happened here.  

This started as a set of ornaments.  I wanted to play with lovely tiny twisted stitch cables, and I wanted to use a fingering weight yarn to emphasize just how delicate cables like that can be.  Ornaments seemed like the perfect canvas for something so delightfully intricate.  

But before the ornaments were even off the needles I was daydreaming about what the same patterns would look like as full sized hats.  But instead of using a fingering weight yarn, I wanted to use a fluffy worsted weight.  That would transform the stitches that were so delicate on the ornaments into something bold and dramatic on the hats.  

The idea was too good to resist, and I couldn't be happier with the result!

<hr><hr><hr>

The collection includes the patterns for all three hats in both full size versions (the ones you'd wear) and miniature versions (the ones you'd hang on a tree or tie on a present).

The full size hats are written in three sizes each (castons of about 100, 110, or 120 stitches, though the exact number varies by pattern), and you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the pieces. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a fabric you like with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 5, 5.5, or 6 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for your size.  With that range of sizes and gauges, the hats will fit a head between 19.75 and 25 inches (with *lots* of points in between).  You can almost certainly make any size hat with less than 225 yards of yarn.

The miniature hats are written in one size.  Gauge isn't quite as important for these, but I recommend working at something like 7 stitches per inch to make a hat that's about 3.5 inches across and 3.5 inches tall.  You'll need less than 50 yards of yarn to make one ornament (plus up to 25 yards of yarn for the tassel, if you decide to make one).

<hr><hr><hr>

**These are perfect for you if:**
* You feel a hat phase coming on
* You've got room on your tree for a few more ornaments
* You now feel a burning need to give someone a new hat, wrapped up all pretty, with a mini version of the hat on top as a gift tag (or is that just me?)

**They’re** ***not*** **for you if:**

* You don't like charts (the pattern uses charts)
* You hate swatching (you need to swatch to check your needle size)

The miniature versions were originally released as part of the Adorn ornament collection by Knit Picks, so if you have that, you already have the ornament patterns.  The full sized versions are only available in the Spicule pattern.

708057,Chunky Harvest Hats,Susan B. Anderson,2.33,3.0,1.0,stockinette stitch,,"Welcome to the first free pattern for the Barrett Wool Co. Journal. This pattern will always be available on the blog and will not be offered as a pdf download. 

Chunky Harvest Hats

Susan B. Anderson

[Click here to find the pattern on the Barrett Wool Co. Journal!][1]

It was about 20 years ago that I knit my first pumpkin hat. A little over 10 years ago my version of a pumpkin hat was published in my first book, Itty-Bitty Hats. That is one of the most popular hats in the book by far. In tribute to the 10-year anniversary of [Itty-Bitty Hats][2] and the [Little Pumpkin Hat][3], I decided to take the colors in Barrett Wool Co. that represent the traditional fall harvest fruits and vegetables and knit some hats. Here I am offering a Pumpkin Hat, Eggplant Hat, Apple Hat, Grape Hat, and a Yellow Squash Hat from which to choose. Really though even if you're not in the mood for a fruit or vegetable, this is just a good, simple chunky weight hat that could be knit up in ANY color or combination of colors or stripes or textures! Let your imagination run wild.

For this new version of the Chunky Harvest Hats I put a fun twist on the original Little Pumpkin hat in that you hold two strands of Home Worsted Weight doubled throughout the entire hat and you knit on a larger size needle at 3 stitches per inch. This makes for a super-squishy fabric that works up in the blink of an eye. I also added lots of sizes, six sizes to be exact, in the pattern that will fit a newborn up to an adult size head! You could always play around with making the brim longer for a cuffed style, too.

Sizes: Newborn (3-6 months, 6-12 months, toddler/small child, large child, teen/adult)

Hat circumference in inches: 12 (14, 16, 18, 20, 22) inches

Sizing Suggestions:

~ For a snug-fitting hat, 1 to 2-inches of negative ease is suggested. For example, if the head circumference measures 15-inches make the 14-inch size. Rounding down to the next size if the measurement is in between the listed measurements.

~ For a looser-fitting hat or if you want room to grow, select the size that is the same measurement as the head circumference or go up to the next size. For example, if the head measurement is 15-inches make the 16-inch size.

Yarn: [Barrett Wool Co. Home Worsted Weight][4] held doubled throughout, (230 yards, 210 meters/100 grams), 1 skein of each in the following colors.

Pumpkin: Marmalade and Grassland

Apple: Red Flannel and Grassland

Yellow Squash: Humble Gold and Ellie Gray

Grape: Bluff and Grassland

Eggplant: Pepin and Grassland

Enjoy!

Gravel is a light, extremely wearable hat and mitt set. Small details — like a stretchy cast-on, textured rib, convertible design, and striking pompom — make this pattern a modern take on a classic design.

**THE HAT** is a simple pattern with an oversized folded rib, which effectively doubles the fabric in the lower part of the hat for structure to support the pompom while leaving the upper part of the hat light enough for a bit of a slouch. 

**THE MITTS** are designed to be extra long, so the top edge can be folded down for classic fingerless mitts or pulled straight to completely cover the fingertips. Gradual increases for the thumb work up within the textured rib pattern for an, elegant, well-shaped mitt.

This one is different because of the hat decreases. I didn't like the decreases in other designs looked so I found a way that looks better and fits better.

A note about yarn choices. I can easily get a hat out of any of the Lion Brand Thick and Quick skeins. It does take a little over a skein when I use Plymouth Encore Mega. Your yardage usage might vary from mine though.

I included an option to make this into a messy bun beanie at the end of the pattern.  I sell them at craft shows and they are SUPER popular. People love them.

A note about the pom pom: It was made using Silver Fox Faux Fur from Joann's Fabrics. I cut out a 6"" circle for this size and I find it's a great size for my hats.

1097026,one dark blue night,Sara Bauer,3.78,28.0,4.0,stockinette,250.0,"This hat is the third in a series of patterns inspired by teachings in Clarissa Pinkola Estés’ Women Who Run with the Wolves. This time, I drew inspiration from Estés’ retelling of a Japanese tale, Tsukina Waguma or “The Crescent Moon Bear,” in which a young woman travels to the cave of an incredibly intimidating and ferocious bear.  She makes several journeys to the cave, leaving food and quickly retreating, until “one dark blue night,” she musters the courage to stand her ground and ask for what she seeks--one hair from a moon-shaped patch on the bear’s chest--which she is granted.  The young woman returns, triumphant, to the old healer who has sent her on this quest. She believes this single hair is the magic ingredient in solving the problem that plagues her.  She holds it forth, but the healer tosses the hair into the flames.  The young woman is in despair until she realizes the true lesson of her quest: that using her determination, courage, and patience, as she did with the crescent moon bear, will help her to confront the challenge at hand. 

The moon phase motif of this colorwork hat is meant to capture the magic of a dark blue night--when the moon shines brightly overhead, the frosty air sparkles with possibility, and we succeed in summoning accumulated wisdom from deep within ourselves so that we can apply it to our own healing.   Choose colors to conjure a wintery night sky, or select a palette of your signature colors. 

This pattern has been tech edited and test knit.

The purchase price of $8 US accurately reflects the time, energy, expertise and effort that has gone into creating this pattern. Sales of my knitting patterns help to support the cost of maintaining my audio podcast, and I am very appreciative of your purchase.

He is also wearing his holiday finest: holly and a jingle bell.  Scarfy comes in 5 sizes from child through adult.  It was knit in worsted. 

**Sizes**	
Sizes are approximate and determined by gauge, yarn chosen, and the knitter.

Child (16 in), Teen/Small Adult (17 ½ in), Medium Adult (19 ¼ in), Large Adult (21 in), Extra Large (22 ½ in)

**Materials**
Worsted weight yarn in two colors, red and cream or white.  Hat shown in sizes Medium and Child in these yarns: 

MC: Cascade 220 (100% Peruvian wool, 220 yds/100 gms), Natural 8010, ~55 grams 

CC: Malabrigo Rios (100% Superwash Merino, 210 yds/100 gms), color Cereza, ~50 grams 

Small amounts of orange yarn, black yarn, and green yarn for carrot nose, eyebrows, and holly leaves.  Buttons (2, black, 5/8 inch), jingle bell.  Very small amount of stuffing, or cotton ball, for nose.

**Needles**
US Size 6 (4mm) circular needles or size needed to achieve gauge; length depends on your preferred knitting technique (i.e., magic loop, etc.) for ~20 inches in the round;
US Size 5 (3.75 mm) circular needles (one size smaller than above, for ribbing), see note about length 
Size 6 DPNs (for shaping at crown); Size 5 DPNs (for carrot nose and holly leaves)

**Gauge**
20 sts and 28 rounds on larger needle in stockinette in the round after blocking

**Yarnover Reverse Purl**
I use an abbreviation in the pattern (in the holly leaves instruction) that I made up.  It might be confusing, so I created a very short video to walk you through the method used.  It is called [Scarfy YRP Demonstration][1].  The updated pattern also includes this link.

1304463,Lift A Twist Beanie,Sara Hemsath,3.33,26.5,4.0,"k1, p1 Rib",166.0,"When I’m knitting, I love a fun texture and a little bit of interest in a pattern. What I don’t like is doing techniques that interrupt the flow of my knitting. I love the way cables look, but I don’t love stopping to pick up a cable needle, or trying to manage stitches by dropping them off my needle. In theory, this type of pattern would be my nemesis. But, I figured out a technique that requires neither of those things, nor does it interrupt the flow of knitting. The best part is that it works for k1, p1 cable combinations, like in the left twist. This left twist technique replaces the traditional technique of having to try to purl through the back loop. The name of this beanie will make sense when you see how to do the special left twist technique.

Skill Level
Intermediate/Advanced Intermediate
Knowledge of cables and twisted stitches is helpful to understand the special left twist technique used for this pattern.

This pattern is designed with a very slight wide set rib brim, for texture, which is carried into the body of the hat in a dispersed formation. The crown shaping is worked with center-double decreases for structure. 

The Simplicity Slouchy Hat is written for both heavy DK / Worsted and Fingering weight yarns, offering two finished weight options for weather variety. 
(See [Simplicity Slouchy Hat Lite][1] for Fingering weight version).

I personally love the lite version for Springtime temperatures while the heavy DK weight / Worsted weight is great for Fall and Winter.

This is a fun and quick beginner-friendly design!

Finally. The Minnesota-inspired, passive-aggressive hat to solve the dreaded question, “Can you knit me that?” Instead of skirting around the issue, you can now satisfy the request with a genuine, hand knitted gift. (Replying with “You betcha!” is optional.) Just don’t tell the recipient that it took you less than one evening or that you didn’t use your best yarn! 

But don’t worry if you keep the hat for yourself. Your secret is safe with me if you choose to avoid answering the dreaded question and instead use that special skein of yarn for yourself!

819156,Smoke In The City,Knitting Daddy Greg,2.55,20.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,140.0,"As a kid, anytime my parents drove us through the city, I was mesmerized by smoke billowing from smokestacks. I loved to watch the giant puffs drifting off with the wind, eventually converging and streaking the sky with clouds. My dad’s friend even convinced me that the factories were manufacturing the clouds! (I was a gullible four-year-old. Gimme a break.) Thanks to better environmental guidelines, smokestacks emit mostly water vapor nowadays. Nevertheless, I’m still enchanted by the swirling trails over the city.

Smoke in the City is a hat that reminds me of those twirling patterns in the sky. Bands of seed stitch rise from stacks of ribbing at the brim and twist towards the crown. The smoke converges at the top into a neat swirl. Knit in worsted weight, this hat works up quickly and is suitable for men and women. Yarns in solid or tonal colorways will work best to show off the hat's texture; wildly variegated yarns will not.

They are easy to knit, warm, unisex, and one size. The hat is comfortably large. The cowl is 28"" x 10.5"". There are a few interesting techniques for a beginner to learn, the Icelandic bind off, the improved Central Double Decrease and a Left Handed Cast on for the hat. The sizes can be adjusted just by changing needle sizes or yarn choices. I searched my stash for inspiration and the worsteds were plentiful and my best choice.

Two strands of worsted yarn are held together creating a marled effect. Solids work, and I like one solid or tonal and one variegated, too. Merino was chosen because it is so warm and soft, making the fabric lofty and completely comfortable next to your skin, barring any wool allergies, of course.

1296936,Glisten In The Snow Beanie,Melissa Taibi,2.33,11.0,2.0,Stockinette,180.0,"This knitted beanie pattern works up quickly and is written for an advanced beginner. 
The “Glisten in the Snow Beanie” is written for worsted yarn weights. The pattern suggests a variegated and a tonal/solid color combination, but you can also use two solids or tonals together. The variety of color combinations that can be used in this pattern make this a great unisex hat, and is easily adjustable to make a hat in a size that will fit you. 
This pattern is worked from the brim up and to be knit in the round. You will need to be familiar with using circular knitting needles and basic stitches. There are two rounds in which I catch my floats, but if you are a loose tension knitter you can carry them. Must be familiar with basic-stranded color work, and reading a chart.

Through the years, I’ve taken all sorts of art classes to explore new techniques and sharpen my creative skills. Among other exercises, I’ve tried blind contour drawings, which are created with a single line without looking at the subject and without lifting the pencil off the page. There’s a beauty and simplicity to using a single line to define an object. **BLIND CONTOUR HAT** uses a single elegant line with intuitive German short rows to create a subtly slouchy hat with only the starting and ending tails to weave in.

When I’m fired up about a project and a color scheme or texture, it’s tough to put the brakes on and make a swatch. In her book, Knitters Almanac, Elizabeth Zimmermann recommends making what she calls “Experimental Caps.”

I designed this hat to be a swatch project for the Liska Sweater. Grab a couple of fingering weight colors that you’ve been curious about and cast on an experimental cap. If after blocking, you find that your gauge is off, you can forge on and in Zimmerman’s wise words, this one “is sure to fit somebody.” Cast on a second time, using a different needle size to see if your next experimental cap will get that gauge just right. This one is a blast to knit in a variety of color schemes. Ritual Dyes yarns are deeply saturated; giving you all kinds of bright options to work with.

**Yarn Recommendations**
The yarn recommendations listed below are a result of my best estimation. They are approximate. Gauge and substitutions will affect the amount you’ll need.

1317142,Spinning in Infinity,Sarah Jordan,0.0,,4.0,,400.0,"I have always loved the look of swirled decreases in a hat crown, but I hate playing yarn chicken or feeling like I'm wasting my yarn if I have leftovers when I'm done. The solution to this conundrum is to work a hat from the top down, from the center of the crown out.

This pattern uses a center-out cast-on method I've developed called the Infinity Inside-Out Cast-on and includes a photo tutorial for it. It's designed to use any yarn knit at any gauge you like; some general suggestions are given for picking a needle size for your yarn. And while following the pattern as written gives you a basic beanie-style hat, you can use the general construction with other hat patterns or stitch patterns to create your own interpretation.

To knit this pattern, you need to know how to:

* work in the round and
* do a lifted increase (instructions in pattern).

Notions needed: one stitch marker, yarn needle, measuring tape or ruler

How much yarn you need will depend on the size you're making and the gauge at which you're knitting, but most people will need 50-100 g (or about half a skein to a full skein). Knitting for a large head or knitting a hat with lots of extra length may require more than one full skein. The benefit of this pattern is that you can try the hat on as you go and completely customize the fit.

SKILL LEVEL:

Confident Intermediate/Advanced 

SIZE:

Average adult - but provides number of stitches to decrease or increase size as needed for your desired measurements.

MATERIALS:

Yarn- Worsted (weight 4). Pattern is written for 2 colors. My suggestion is using one variegated, and one tonal, or two tonals. You can use either one for MC or CC and the Brim can be knit in either color before switching to the body rounds which are indicated in the pattern. 
Brim in CC before body section uses 80 yards each of both color (44g) 
Brim and body in MC uses 104 yards (58g) MC and 49-55 yards (27-30g). 

Needles- For a average worsted (such as recommended AFW):  US 6 for brim, US 5 and US 8 for the body. For Light worsted (such as Malabrigo Rios): US 5 for brim, US 5 and US 7 for body. 
I highly recommend using interchangeable needles as you only need to switch the needle on your RH cable to affect the side of your stitch which makes swapping between the rounds much easier. 

Other Supplies- Scissors, tapestry needle, Stitch Marker

When paired with a coordinating solid color yarn, the rhythmic pattern works well to break up any awkward pooling and the whole thing comes together like magic, ending with a star motif at the crown! The idea for this hat slipped into my head during a long and sleepless night, and I hope you enjoy knitting it as much as I did.

Preemie (4-5 lbs/2 kgs) or doll - 10"" x 5"" (25 cm x 12.5 cm)
Newborn - 12"" x 5.5"" (30 cm x 14 cm)

Medium adult - 18"" x 8"" (46 cm x 20 cm)
Large adult - 19.5"" x 8.5"" (49,5 cm x 21,5 cm)
Extra-large adult - 22"" x 9"" (56 cm x 23 cm)

Length can be easily adjusted, and the hat is quite stretchy. For baby and children’s sizes, this provides a nice bit of growing room. For adult sizes, I recommend going one size down if you prefer a more snug-fitting hat.

Gauge matters! I suggest knitting a Swatch Hat with the yarn you intend to use for future hats. Measure gauge after your item has been washed and blocked (non-superwash yarns) or machine-washed if you're using machine washable yarns. Cast on for the smallest size in the pattern and measure how many stitches per inch are achieved in the round. Adjust your cast on number and/or needle size(s) accordingly.

ETA 12/9: the links didn't work in the original PDF, so I've now updated it to fix them. Sorry!

Note: Because someone asked, the gauge given is for the box-patterned, upper part of the hat. The gauge at the brim is more like 26 sts / 4""; the hat edge measures about 20"" (It's possible the lining I sewed in is stretching it a bit.) 

12/11: Updated pattern to add some sizing information and correct one mistake: you need an odd number of stitches for the tvåändsstickning section, but an even number for the box pattern, so you need to M1 at the end of the brim.

12/15: Found and corrected error in the tvåändsstickning section. CO should be 136 sts after all, and colors in twined knit rows should be lined up with those in crook rows.

523605,Braided-Edge Baby Hat,Becky Colvin,3.09,22.0,2.0,stockinette with size 1 needles,150.0,"I made two variations of the hat pattern. The first (the cuffed hat) has a delicate braid and keeps the “rough” back of the cable away from baby’s face. It does require more yarn & more knitting time, as you are essentially knitting an extra 1 ½ inches or more of stockinette stitch for the cuff. 

The second variation I call “Scalloped”—it has a wider braid (16 stitches instead of 12) which serves as the band for the hat. With a single purl stitch on the edge of the braid, the edge looks more defined. As long as you use a soft baby yarn, there shouldn’t be any issues with discomfort. I used Dale Baby Ull in pale pink & lavendar and size 1 needles. Baby Ull is a fine gauge fingering weight wool. Other baby weight yarns are fine, too. 

My Gauge—22 stitches per 2 inches (5.2 cm). Row gauge doesn’t matter, since the majority of the pattern is given in lengths. If your yarn or needles create a different gauge, I give instructions to make adjustments when you pick up the stitches from the cable. 

Note:  The current free pattern has been edited for errors.  If you downloaded your pattern prior to October 12, make a note of the Errata.

Errata:  Scalloped Edge Hat should begin with 

cast on 11. Row 1—wrong side row—k2, p8, k1. 

Row 2—right side row—p1, increase in each of the next 8 stitches (or make 1, k1 8 times), p2.",,164,372,4.33,"fits newborns, 13-14"" head circumference",Fingering

Minimalist yet bold with symmetrically-aligned pops of color inspired by Swiss Design, Lucerne is an enjoyable and instructive guide for beginning adventures in colorwork. All stranded colorwork rounds are worked as 3-and-1 repeats — three stitches of one color, punctuated by one stitch in a contrast color. This consistent ratio aids in keeping even colorwork tension, with all floats being the same length throughout. The intuitive colorwork motif can be worked with as few as two colors or with as many as four. With Peerie’s extensive palette of painterly shades, opportunities for experimentation and colorplay abound!

Brooklyn Tweed Peerie (100% American Merino wool; 210 yards/50 grams)

* 1 skein of Color 1 (C1) 
* 1 skein of Color 2 (C2) 
* *Optional*: 1 skein of Color 3 (C3) 
* *Optional*: 1 skein of Color 4 (C4)

*Note: Pattern requires at least two colors and can optionally use up to four. C3 is for the three and four-color versions and C4 is for the four-color version.*

Photographed in the following colorways:

Sample I: Fleet (C1) & Admiral (C2)
Sample II: Nocturne (C1), Morel (C2), Tincture (C3) & Marigolds (C4)
Sample III: Norway (C1), Thaw (C2), Rainier (C3) & Mesa (C4)

Sample V: Cobbler (C1) & Cassis (C2)
Sample VI: Porter (C1), Driftwood (C2) & Henge (C3)

**Yardage**

Fingering weight wool yarn:

* Two-color version: 153 yards C1; 60 yards C2
* Three-color version: 157 yards C1, 23 yards C2; 23 yards C3
* Four-color version: 120 yard C1; 37 yards C2; 14 yards C3; 10 yards C4

*Yarn amounts given are sufficient to make hat in either length.*

**Gauge**

* 28 stitches & 32 rounds = 4"" in colorwork motif with Size A needle(s), after blocking

**Needles**

Size A (for Main Fabric)

* One 16"" circular needle and one set of double-pointed needles (DPNs)* in size needed to obtain gauge listed
* Suggested Size: 3¾ mm (US 5)

Size B (for Ribbing)

* One 16"" circular needle* three or four sizes smaller than Size A
* Suggested Size: 2¾ mm (US 2)

Size C (optional; for Tubular Cast On only)

* One 16"" circular needle* one size smaller than Size B
* Suggested Size: 2¼ mm (US 1)


\* 32"" circular needle can be used instead of 16” circular and DPNs if using the Magic Loop method for working small circumferences in the round.

*Note: The body of the hat is a combination of stranded (2-color) rounds and single-color rounds. Some knitters do not get the same stitch gauge on the same needle between their colorwork and single-color knitting. If this is the case, you may wish to switch to an alternate needle size on single-color rounds to maintain the 7 stitches per inch gauge required for the pattern. We recommend Speed-Swatching for Circular Knitting.*

**Finished Dimensions**

* 20½\"" \[52 cm] circumference, 7¾ (8¼)\"" \[19.75 (21) cm] length for short hat (long hat)

*Note: Hat is sized to fit adult head sizes ranging from 20-23"" \[51-58.5 cm] circumference with a short and long version. For large head sizes \[23-25” (58.5-63.5 cm)] work the long version – the added length will provide more stretch and will fit a larger head size.*

**Tutorials for all special techniques listed below are included in the pattern:**

* Speed Swatching for Circular Knitting 
* Color Dominance 
* 1×1 Tubular Cast On 
* 2×2 Tubular Cast On

888467,Simple Worsted Hat,Julie Conway,1.67,20.0,4.0,,,"After trying many patterns, I finally combined my favorite elements to create this Simple Worsted Hat pattern. This is my go-to simple hat pattern for worsted weight yarn, but can be adjusted for any weight yarn.

This is good hat for beginners, and for experienced knitters it is easy to customize by adding stripes and patterns. The options are endless. To adjust sizes, just increase or decrease the cast on stitches in multiples of 8.

I highly recommend Sweet Georgia Trinity Worsted yarn for this hat. It knits up perfect and it is squishy softness with just the right density - not too light and not too heavy.

Add some fuzzy softness to the hat by adding some mohair to the hat. Hold mohair with your favorite worsted yarn for a soft, squishy hat.

Finish it off with a pom pom. I purchase mine from FFFabuknits on Etsy.  https://www.etsy.com/shop/FFFabuknits

Featuring stripes of small colourwork motifs, or ""peeries"", Cairngorm is a fun, accessible project for practicing your colourwork skills on. Shown in three colours, with only two colours per round, there's plenty of room for creativity. You could easily simplify things further with just two shades, or work every stripe in a different combination. For our samples we used two of our favourite classic colourwork yarns: Jamieson and Smith 2ply Jumper Weight and Rauma Finull PT2. Both have an amazing range of over 100 colours, so you can enjoy choosing the perfect palette for your style – or everyone in your family. 

Cairngorm is worked bottom up in the round, with a contrast cast on worked using the alternating cable cast on – a fantastic cast-on for ribbing that you'll love adding to your skills toolbox. Choose from a neat single layer ribbed band, or a cosy double layered brim. The hat pattern includes three sizes, and is written for a slightly slouchy length, with decreases neatly incorporated into the crown patterning.

**Mountains of Japan. A Hat.** 

The Mountains of Japan are breathtaking in person.  I come from an area in the USA with lots of mountains.  I have seen  the White and Green mountains, the Smokey Mountains and the mountains of Iceland and the Alps.  I have seen a lotta mountains.  I was not prepared for my first views of the mountains in Japan.  I always wondered why Japanese nature art was so different from Western art.  Then I saw Japan and understood.  The mountains look painted in the distance.  Hanging in the clouds, shades of grey and blue and black in the distance.  Hints of the shapes, not the all the lines filled in.  Amazing.   This hat is my knit interpretation.  Go see them in real life if you have the chance.  There is an alternate set of charts for flat-topped mountains, so choose the graph that looks like the mountains in your mind….

Meet **Luna**, lovely and incredibly soft hat. Luna is a word of Latin origin meaning Moon. The hat begins with twisted ribbing, highly defined cable pattern in the middle and an eight-petal flower for the crown. It is designed for kidsilk mohair & fingering weight yarns held together. The mohair creates a halo around every stitch, making this hat soft and warm with a misty glow - just like the moon light.

PATTERN
My pattern is 4 pages long with written instructions and chart. The hat is worked with two yarns held together from beginning to end.

Knit using a unique construction, it is the ultimate mindless knit until the last few rounds when you must focus a bit to turn all that stockinette into an actual hat. 

The final result is a two layer hat with only smooth stockinette showing on the inside and outside. It is all one piece in the end, so there is no shifting out of place of the layers.

1045677,Color Quadrant Cap,James N Watts,2.82,22.0,4.0,2x2 ribbing,340.0,"Color Quadrant Cap is an intarsia hat that uses four colors. The hat is knit flat and seamed. It is a 2x2 ribbed beanie that can be knit short and fitted, or long and slouchy. This is a great first intarsia pattern and an awesome scrap buster project. Video tutorials are included with the pattern to help introduce you to intarsia techniques. Use #ColorQuadrantCap on Instagram and contact me at jamesnwattsknits@gmail.com for pattern support.  

**Size**
Due to the negative ease in this pattern and the stretchy nature of ribbing, Color Quadrant Cap will fit both children and adults. You can easily customize this hat to your desired depth by simply knitting shorter or longer before beginning the decreases, instructions are provided for a very short fitted style to be worn above the ears as well as a longer slouchy style. The finished circumference is 17 inches around.

**Yarn**
Four different colors of:
Fingering weight held double
or DK weight held single
or worsted weight held single

you can also use a mixture of the above yarn weights between your four colors. This is a great stash buster project. You only need 60-85 grams of yarn to knit this hat, so that's 15-22 grams of each color. My short sample used 60 grams, and my slouchy sample used 75 grams.

If using fingering weight doubled you will need 60-85 yards for one quadrant, if using Dk or Worsted, you will need 30-43 yards for one quadrant.

**Tools**

* US 6(4mm) knitting needles—or size needed to get gauge 

* Darning needle for mattress stitch and weaving in ends.

The hat is constructed with a deep, stretchy ribbed brim, and a tall slouchy body with gathered crown. This pattern is appropriate for intermediate knitters who have done some stranded colorwork before. Charts are provided for all sizes. The pattern includes links to YouTube tutorials for the cast-on and the Latvian braid.

You will need 60g of each of two strongly-contrasting colors (most testers used under 50g). Select a yarn appropriate for colorwork: wool, alpaca, acrylic, or a similar fiber with halo (so the stitches fluff up and nest together) and drape (so the hat slouches).

You will need needle sizes appropriate for ribbing, stockinette, and stranded colorwork; most knitters will use three successive sizes to achieve good tension across all three of these types of fabric.

The simple cables on this hat resemble leaves, the slipped stitches forming the leaf stem. The cables wind upward toward the crown, ending in gentle decreases and giving a snug, cozy fit. A simple 8-row repeat makes this a versatile knit, easily adjustable to different lengths.

This hat is worked from the bottom up, starting at the brim and working upward toward the crown of the head. The brim is worked in a simple 2x2 ribbing, which flows effortlessly into the charted cables that form the leaves.

I recommend using a non-superwash wool for this hat, it will give a beautifully sturdy fabric with a buttery soft texture.

Are you ready for Spring?! Then grab this sweet treat of a hat pattern and start knitting up some cute chicks and bunnies.

Sized for the entire family, get started on this seamless, in-the-round, stranded colorwork hat today.

Finished measurements: For a toddler (child/small adult, large adult). Please go by actual head circumference sizes not descriptive sizes, some small children have large heads, and some older folks have small ones. Approximately 15.5”(18”, 20.5”)/39(46cm, 52cm) circumference and 6.75”(8”, 9.75”) /17(20, 25)cm tall to fit a 17”-19”(19.5-21.5”, 22-24”)43-48(49.5-54.5, 55.5-61) cm head respectively.

Note that this pattern does have some longer floats, so this pattern is not recommended as a first colorwork pattern. (But if you really want to knit it you can always duplicate stitch the design on afterwards).

Getting gauge in colorwork is TRICKY because we need to worry both about stitch and row gauge - with single color projects we usually are told to knit so many inches so the row gauge doesn't matter, but in colorwork it does matter since there is a fixed pattern you have to work. When you have tight floats, this will usually cause your stitch count to be higher than recommended and your row count to be lower than recommended (making your project narrower but HIGHER).  Many knitters will go up needle sizes to get stitch gauge which will help the width, but make the project even HIGHER!!! 

If you don't want this, try to keep your original needle size (or even go down if your row gauge will make the project too high), and instead go up a pattern size or two if that is an option. This way, your project will now fit the desired width but not be extra, extra high.  


The amounts needed per color are as follows:
Worsted weight yarn. 
Approx. 60(75, 85) yds / 55(69, 78) m of main color. 
Approx. 35(40, 45)yds / 32(37, 41) m of brim color. 
Approx. 25(30, 35) yds / 23(27, 32) m of CC1 (chicks).
Approx. 30(35, 40) yds / 27(32, 37) m of CC2 (bunnies). 
Optional: A small amount of dark yarn for the eyes and nose.

Pictured in *Malabrigo Worsted colors Natural, Apple Green, Pollen, and Shocking Pink*. For a little more contrast between the chicks and background try making the MC background Apple Green and the ribbing and accents either Natural or one of chick and bunny colors. Alternatively, you might want to try *Simple Taupe* as main color, or make the chicks a brighter color like *Sauterne*. See the Spring Treats Headbands for photos of some of these options.

While the sample is knit with four different colors , you can use two or any number of colors. This is great for using up leftovers.

There’s nothing like taking a walk in the woods after a fresh snowfall.  A revitalizing, clean scent in the air that renews the spirit.  Listening to that quiet crunch, crunch of the snow under your feet. And maybe, just maybe, spotting evidence that gentle deer and curious sparrows have also been enjoying the morning.

7303388,Alba Fog Hat,Gretchen Mac,0.0,24.0,4.0,,583.0,"The Alba Fog hat is the coziest way to keep your head warm on misty winter mornings. With a squishy textured stitch pattern and  cuddly combination of alpaca and mohair yarn, this accessory makes a wonderful gift and is a delight to knit.

The hat  is worked in the round from the bottom up with a tubular cast on and folded brim. The simple cable pattern is combined with unique decreases to create side seams,  and the hat is finished with a small grafted section at the crown. Sizes range from infant to adult, and instructions are both written and charted. 

**Finished Measurements and Sizing:** 
Sizes: Baby, Toddler, Child, (Adult S, Adult M, Adult L.) Referred to in pattern as sizes 1, 2, 3, (4, 5, 6.)

To fit head circumference: 15”, 17”, 19”, (21”, 23”, 25”) / 37.5, 42.5, 47.5, (52.5, 57.5, 62.5) cm

Finished circumference: 11 ⅔”, 13”, 15 ⅔”, (17”, 19 ⅔”, 21”) / 29 ¼, 32 ½, 39 ¼, (42 ½, 49 ¼, 52 ½) cm

Finished height with brim folded: 5 ¾”, 6 ¾”, 8”, (8 ½”, 10”, 11”) / 14 ½, 17, 20, (21 ¼, 25, 27) cm

*A note on sizing:* I wrote this pattern to be very size inclusive, so the size range is more extensive than many hat patterns. Please be sure to measure your head circumference when choosing a size, and keep in mind that you need 3-4” of negative ease for the hat to feel like it fits properly. This hat has additional height built into the ribbing in the larger sizes, and is intended to fold over the body stitch pattern if needed so that you can adjust height for your preferred fit. 

**Needles & Notions:** US 7 / 4.5 mm and US 5 / 3.75 mm needles for working in the round, or size needed to obtain gauge.

DPNs or circular needles with a longer cable for Magic Loop in US 7 / 4.5 mm, for working the decrease section of the hat and for grafting.

Stitch markers and tapestry needle.

**Gauge:** 24 sts and 32 rounds = 4” (10 cm) in the round, in charted pattern on larger needles. 

**Yarn & Yardage:** This hat is made with two yarns held together: Knit Picks Andean Treasure (DK weight alpaca) and Knit Picks Aloft (lace weight mohair.)

For Andean Treasure, you will need 35, 45, 68, (81, 105, 126) g, {1.24, 1.59, 2.39, (2.87, 3.71, 4.46) oz} / 77, 99, 149, (179, 231, 278) yds, {71, 91, 136, (164, 212, 254) m}. There are 50 g (1.76 oz) / 110 yds (101 m) per skein. 

For Aloft, you will need 8, 10, 15, (19, 24, 29) g, {.28, .37, .54, (.66, .85, 1.03) oz} / 82, 108, 159, (194, 249, 305) yds {75, 99, 145, (178, 228, 279) m}. There are 25 g (.88 oz) /  260 yds (238 m) per skein. 10% overage included for both yarns. 

*A note on yarn selection:* Because this hat is knit in the round, it has a slight tendency to skew sideways. This will block out when using an animal fiber yarn, but not if using a synthetic yarn. While the skewing effect is minimal during wear, an alpaca or wool blend yarn is recommended for best results.

7315832,Hidden Scraps Beanie,Haley Carter,1.75,22.0,4.0,1x1 Rib,690.0,"The Hidden Scraps Beanie is a warm and cozy ribbed hat. This hat is made from fingering weight yarn held double for a deliciously dense fabric, and the double-folded brim is triple thick for extra warmth.

This design was created to make the most out of single skeins! All sizes can be knit from 100g or less for your main color. Scrap yarn is cleverly hidden away to become invisible when worn. 

This pattern is also great for those with yarn sensitivities. For example, scrap yarn sections can be knit with a cashmere and mohair can be added to the main color for the fluffy, halo look without the discomfort that can sometimes come with mohair. 

Get creative! Theres so many possibilities with this pattern.

> Pop][3], Pop Fizzle, and [Pop
> Twizzle][4]!

Pop Fizzle is a slightly slouchy hat with a chevron lace detail, knit using the two-color brioche stitch. This hat is worked in the round from the bottom up. Two-color brioche creates a gorgeous reversible fabric! So now, it’s like you have two hats!  Using less than one skein of yarn per color (no matter what size you make), this hat makes a great stash-buster or a wonderful gift! 

**A French Translation is available!** Click on the pattern download button on the top right of this page and you will have the option of downloading an alternative French Version (Translated by Claire Berrier).

**Skill level:** Intermediate. Basic two color brioche skills are not required, but are recommended. Techniques used: knitting in the round, brioche knit (brk), brioche purl (brp), brioche increases and decreases.

This pattern is both written and charted, for your convenience! 

If you have not yet tried knitting brioche, fear not!!  This hat may look complicated, but the twists and turns are made by increasing and decreasing the brioche stitches and are so much fun once you learn!  This pattern is written so that ANYONE can knit it, with photo tutorials and links to videos teaching the techniques. I also highly recommend visiting Nancy Marchant's website: www.briochestitch.com.  She is the best teacher for this amazing stitch!!  

**Size and Gauge:** There are 3 size options for this hat. The sizing is determined by simply switching what weight of yarn you use, making it a great stash-buster! The hat shown in the pattern and main photo is Option 1, the smallest size, modeled on a 22"" adult head. 
***Option 1:*** 21 sts x 25 rows = 4” - 19"" C x 9.5"" H (slouchy)
***Option 2:*** 20 sts x 23 rows = 4” - 19.5"" C x 9.5"" H (slouchier)
***Option 3:*** 18 sts x 22 rows = 4” - 20"" C x 10"" H (slouchiest)
In all options, gauge is measured in straight two-color brioche stitch (taken after blocking).

**Yarn:** 
***Option 1:*** **Main color (MC):** 90yds / 82m sport weight yarn
**Contrast color (CC):** 180yds / 165m sock/fingering weight yarn, held double (meaning I held two strands of yarn together while knitting)
***Option 2:*** **MC:** 110yds / 101m DK weight yarn
**CC:** 105yds / 96m sport weight yarn
***Option 3:*** **MC:** 95yds / 87m DK weight yarn
**CC:** 105yds / 96m DK weight yarn

**Shown in:**
**MC:** Less than 1 skein Swans Island Ecowash Sport in Verdigris EWB110 (100% Washable Merino Wool; 180 yds per 50g)
**CC:** Less than 1 skein Hedgehog Fibres Sock in Monet (90% superwash merino wool, 10% nylon; 383 yds per 100g)

**Needles:** 16” & 40” US 6/4.0mm circular needle for magic loop method, or US 6/4.0mm DPN’s. I find that circular needles are much easier with complicated brioche stitches.

**Tools:** tapestry needle for weaving in ends, row counter, stitch marker for marking beginning of round, cable needle or stitch marker for use with decreasing sts, 5 contrasting color stitch markers for dividing lace sections.

They teamed up with North Light Fibers and Deborah Newton to offer a hat pattern inspired by seafarers and Rhode Island's historic Block Island.

A traditionally patterned Fair Isle hat in a less traditional slouchy shape. Shown in Jamieson and Smith Heritage and Heritage Naturals a unique worsted spun Shetland wool which blocks into a fine, smooth fabric. The geometric stitch patterns were chosen to work well with the crisp stitch definition of the yarn. The pattern is given in three sizes, due to the 30 stitch pattern repeat the middle size is worked by changing the gauge. Decreases are worked into the final pattern band, which was inspired by the crowns of traditional Fair Isle tams, working the shaping close to the top creates a slightly gathered effect. There will be plenty of the coloured yarn leftover to make a pompom, a cute addition if you can bear to cover up the crown pattern.

There’s something very peaceful about creating a handknit hat. The rhythm of the needles, the flicking of the yarn, and the quiet moments stolen for this simple act of pleasure are all reasons why hats are such a popular thing to knit. The world outside may be turned on end, but for a brief time you find peace. This hat is worked in two colors of Anzula Gerty, with natural wooly goodness that plumps when blocked. The swirls are created with stranded knitting, intended for knitters with colorwork experience who are comfortable trapping floats as needed. Take some time for yourself.

1113217,Trail Point,Ruth Boelkins,3.36,22.0,4.0,stockinette ,200.0,"**Trail Point** is a lightweight and warm hat that anyone would love to wear, whether walking about town, hiking some trails, of fly fishing on the river. This hat takes inspiration from the activities my family enjoys. And we always want to wear something functional and fun on our heads!

The colorful yarns I chose to design with are produced in small batches by artisan dyers. I love collaborations with small businesses like me! 
Dig into their yarn selections at your LYS or in their online shops. The pattern is written as a single color hat, but one skein of Shepherd's Wool Crazy will do all the color patterning for you, and you can let your creativity soar with any number of colors in stripes and blocks using several skeins or mini bobbins of Plied Yarns North Ave.  **Trail Point** is a blank canvas for your ideas - the hem would also be ideal for a little colorwork or surface embroidery, if you fancy adding that!

**Trail Point** is cast on at the bottom and worked in the round to the top. Instructions are included for turning fabric to the inside and joining seamlessly for the hem, live stitches to picked up stitches of the cast on edge, as you go. It makes a clean finish inside the hat, and makes **Trail Point** nicely reversible too.
Shaping uses a few directional decrease stitches, and the top is closed with three needle bind off (glossary includes stitch descriptions and a link for bind off tutorial).

Choose from two sizes, and wear two ways! **Trail Point** has you covered for making all kinds of hats for you, and for all the folks in your life.

**Pattern #37 in the original U.S. National Park inspired
line of beanies**
by Nancy Bates

The iconic Gateway Arch commemorates St. Louis' role in the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century.  At 630 feet tall, the arch is covered in dozens of stainless-steel panels that gleam in the sun and create an interesting checkerboard-type pattern.  For more than 5 decades, millions of families have posed for souvenir photos at the base of this impressive monument.  Using 4 different shades of silvers and greys, this beanie recreates the subtle rectangle pattern of the arch while simple embroidered stick figures pose for a photo at the base.

1197163,Third Winter,Laura Nelkin,3.61,18.0,4.0,= 4 inches [10 cm] in Stockinette stitch in the round on larger needles,178.0,"Pattern is 50% off through Dec 10th (no coupon code needed). (But if you [get a kit][1] the pattern is included)

I designed Third Winter last year, when it seemed that winter would never end.  My coping mechanism was to design a new hat, and a quick stash dive solved the problem. Leftover skeins of Feeder Brook Farm 2-ply combined with JDMS Ansel are the perfect combo. The dyed-in-the-wool Feederbrook creates a subtle color shift in the brim, and contrasts with Ansel beautifully. **AND YES! [There are kits in the shop!!!][2]**

Third Winter begins with a soothing 2-color brioche brim worked in the round.  Once the brim is completed, the work gets turned and the hat body is then knit in one color toward the crown in the opposite direction.  This creates a folded-over, double layer of cozy soft wool around the ears.  

Of course, a [video tutorial][3] is included to teach you how to knit brioche in the round.

The unexpected surprise with this hat was that, because I loved it so much, I didn’t mind that winter kept on going!  Turns out that a surefire way to beat the winter blues is to knit something you want to wear.  Plus, now that winter is here again I’m happy to slap this beauty on my head and head outside! Knit one and maybe you’ll be happy when crummy weather gives you the opportunity to wear it!

1279731,Cozy Cabled Hat,Daryl Kleiman,4.2,16.0,4.0,stockinette,500.0,"The Cozy Cabled Hat is designed to be your go-to warm winter hat.  The secret to its coziness is that it's really two hats, both knitted in the round, brim up: first, you knit the cabled ""outer"" hat using your medium weight yarn, putting in a lifeline as you go; then, you pick up the stitches from your lifeline and knit the ""inner"" lining using your fine weight yarn, held together.  The best part is that you knit the inner hat from picked-up stitches, so there's no seaming or sewing to attach the lining!

This hat is a great project for cable lovers of all levels, as it features two simple cables on the outer hat.

**GAUGE**
16 st/28 rows stockinette = 4"" (10cm) on larger needles, knit flat, before blocking

**YARN**
for cabled ""outer"" hat: 200yds/180m medium weight yarn (e.g.,  aran, worsted, dk)
for lining ""inner""hat: 200yds/180m fine weight yarn (e.g., mohair, lace, boucle)

**SAMPLE YARN AND YARDAGE**

It is a versatile piece that can be worn covering your ears and most of your head or pulled down around neck as a cowl. (Make it into a hat with the bonus instructions included in this pattern.) It is worked in the round in a simple rib pattern except for a cable within an oval turtle cable motif at the front. This is a great little holiday gift that knits up quickly and doesn't take a lot of yarn to make. You'll need a size 8 (5 mm) circular and 64 yards of worsted weight yarn for a headband that is 4.25"" wide and easily stretches to 23"" around. A little less yarn for a narrower headband. Can also be knit with a size 7 (4.5 mm) circular for a slightly smaller headband. Make it a hat with about 109 yards of yarn and some dpns or a longer circular for magic loop to finish the hat top.

Knitting as art has long fascinated me.  I try to do one or two “art” hats or cowls each season.   I used to feel folks were not interested in knitting that requires attention to every stitch, often with non-repetitive motifs.   This is not true, as in recent years, knitting has become elevated to the level of true art and the challenge of knitting a little masterpiece is a welcome change.   The motifs in this hat are traditional, deer and trees, with a slightly different take.  A single deer is taken by the light of the moon in a gently falling snow.  The rest of the hat is forest.   I love the MALABRIGO RIOS colors as they add such depth to the finished hat.

Four sizes are included.   Small, Medium, Large and Large.  Large shown in photos.
Charts are slightly different by size.  Pom Poms shown are dried Cayenne peppers.

**NOTES**
The hat is constructed to be knit top down.
Double brioche fabric is incredibly stretchy. If you are in between sizes, it is advised to pick a smaller size. Depending how you prefer to wear your beanie, it is imperative that you wash and block your finished hat prior to wearing it as it would reflect true fit. You can additionally adjust and manipulate the fabric during the blocking process if desired. In addition, if you are not sure the size will fit the wearer, instead of ripping your work, you can choose to work it longer, as the hat would stretch widthwise and the length of the hat would contract in length to accommodate the circumference.
This hat is completely reversible, with MC or CC being predominantly shown on either side.
This design can be customized to be worked with tall (pointy) or shallow (rounded) crown and additionally hat’s body can be worked for a beanie length or with a foldover brim.

**GAUGE**
22 sts and 58 rnds = 4” / 10 cm in Double Brioche Rib on smaller needle, measured relaxed once dry after washing and blocking
Note that 58 worked rnds in Double Brioche looks like only 29 rnds, because each stitch is slipped (or the equivalent) on alternate rnds.

spots. The hat has a cozy fixed double brim and uses
two strands of worsted held together throughout the
pattern.

At the start of my fiber journey, I collected tons of
affordable acrylic worsted weight yarns in many
colors. I was sure I was going to crochet a million
blankets, but I ended up with lots of yarn left. I
challenged myself to knit with as much of it as I
could. I wrote this pattern years ago as a way to play
with marling two colors together - although the hat
can be knit with two strands of the same color as
well.

This fun stranded colorwork hat is designed to make the most of those interesting single skeins you’ve been eyeing or saving up. With three sizes knit in a chunky or bulky yarn is perfect for gift knitting.

3 - L/XL Adult: 22.5”-24.5” head circumference

Each size can be knit up using less than a full skein of the MC and the CC. Depending on your personal gauge, you may have enough yarn left over to knit a second hat.

SKILL LEVEL:

Intermediate - This pattern is for those who feel comfortable with knitting and have made several projects, using various skills and techniques. Skills/concepts include knits, purls, increases, decreases, slipped stitches, passed stitches, and German short rows. 

Notes from the Designer:

We have experienced so much joy lately, welcoming a new generation into our lives. It has been such a bright spot to share in the excitement of a growing family and the anticipation of what these new, little souls will bring to the world. As a maker, I feel honored to be able to pass on a little something to let them know how much they are cared for.

This pattern includes instructions for a simple baby hat, blanket, and sweater. All are made with easy knit and purl stitches. You may customize the number of colors that you use to make them your own. The sweater is designed for three or more buttons, but you may choose to eliminate them. Whether you make one or make them all, be proud to share them with a little one in your life! 

* Making a gauge swatch is critical to
  achieving the desired results. Please
  DO NOT assume that you knit to the
  same gauge as I do. Yes, it is an
  extra step, but it also ensures that
  what you are knitting will produce
  what you expect. Additionally, you
  won’t need to worry about running out
  of yarn. If you are substituting yarn,
  it is especially important to verify
  that it behaves in the same way as the
  yarn called for in the pattern.
* The sweater may be made in one or more
  colors. I suggest making the color
  changes midway between buttonholes. If
  changing colors, knit the first stitch
  of the row with both colors, drop the
  old color, and continue with the new
  color. After the following row has
  been completed, give a slight tug on
  the tail of the old color. It will
  disappear, leaving a neat front edge.
* When the ‘SM’ is not included in the
  row instructions, simply slip the
  marker as you come to it.
* The sweater
  pattern utilizes short rows using the
  German Short Row method. You will work
  a partial row, turn your work, and
  begin the next portion of the row by
  slipping the first stitch and making a
  “double stitch” (DS). The two legs of
  the DS are counted as one stitch and
  worked together in subsequent rows.
* To switch colors at the beginning of a
  row in the blanket, bring the new
  color up under the old color. Holding
  the new color to the front, slip the
  first stitch, and then knit the next
  stitch with the new color.
* To switch
  colors in the hat, bring the new color
  up under the old color. Doing this
  every time will prevent holes at the
  color change.
* You may determine how
  many buttons to include on the
  sweater. Rows that could include
  buttonholes are indicated by ‘BH’.

Give them as a gift of hope for parents, as milestones for growth, or as remembrances of tiny beginnings. I usually make 3 sizes as a gift, starting with one that will fit the baby right away. They’re a quick knit, so you can whip them up as soon as you hear the news. Wide flat ribbing is comfortable for baby’s head.
Six sizes, by gestational age: (20-21 weeks; 21-22

vary.
Any type of sock yarn will work - just make sure it's soft.
I gave one set to a Mom of very early twins, and she said that while others were preparing her for her babies' possible death, I had sent her hats for them to grow into - hope! - and they did grow.  Another parent told me what a big milestone it was for her preemie to grow into the next hat size.  Don't worry about sending a hat that's too small - then the parent can see that there are babies smaller than theirs, and share them with someone who can wear it.

Please don't sell these hats, or this pattern - knit for those who need warmth, comfort, and hope.

616795,Simple Cable Hat,Miles Riley,2.71,12.0,2.0,,200.0,"This hat is knit from the bottom up on double pointed needles, with a 12 stitch pattern repeat. Suitable for a beginning cabler looking for a simple first project, or a more advanced knitter looking for something that knits up quick.

This is my first attempt at writing a pattern, so feedback is very much appreciated.

**Needles**

One set of double pointed needles for the main body of the hat (I used US #7’s, use whatever you're comfortable with and gives you a gauge you're happy with)

One set of slightly smaller double pointed needles for the ribbing at the brim and finishing the decreasing on top (I used a US #5, but it doesn't matter too much what size you use as long as they're a little smaller)

One significantly larger needle for casting on (I used a US #10.5, alternately you could use two of your double pointed needles held together)

**Yarn**

I used Jo Sharp Classic DK Wool for this project but any DK weight should be fine, if you have sensitive skin you would probably want to go with something much softer than regular 100% wool. You might be able to just squeak by with one ball of yarn for the small, but I'd recommend two to be on the safe side and for the larger sizes.

**Gauge**

I would recommend knitting a test swatch of one pattern repeat with at least a little extra fabric on each side. The 12 stitch pattern segment should measure about 1 ½ inches across unstretched, and about 2 inches gently stretched to get the hat sizes Small (20 inch), Medium (22 inch), and Large (24 inch). With that said, this is a “one size fits most” type of pattern so chances are you’ll be all right if you’d prefer to just start right in.

*I shot an arrow into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
Could not follow it in its flight.*
      -Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

This cozy hat features a classic Norwegian star motif, reworked to include 4 inwardly directed arrows, bordered by a charming peerie pattern. 

It is designed to be rather long, for a more modern, slouchy fit. You can fold the brim up high when you are in the mood for a snugger fit.

The lovely fair isle is simpler to work than it appears, using only 2 colors and small repeats, making it an excellent project for knitters wanting to take their projects to the next level.

A satisfying knit that works up quickly in lovely DK weight yarn. 


See [my blog][1] for tips on fair isle knitting and pompom making!

A branching motif of half-twisted rib creates a striking hat that can be worn with either side out. Twisting the knit stitches throws them into sharp relief; on the verso their untwisted purl neighbors splay and lie flatter for a related but distinct look. Hirombe finishes with an elfin peak as the rib naturally draws in at the crown. The elasticity of the stitch pattern makes this hat stretchy enough to fit anyone.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Construction**

The hat is worked in the round from the brim to the crown.

**Yardage**

160 yards of DK weight yarn

**Yarn**

2 skeins Brooklyn Tweed *Arbor* (100% American Targhee wool; 145 yards/50 grams)
Samples photographed in colors *Butte* and *Loam*

**Gauge**

32 stitches & 34 rounds = 4"" in Hirombe Chart pattern with Size A needle(s), unstretched after blocking
One 24-stitch repeat from Hirombe Chart measures approximately 3"" wide with Size A needle(s), after blocking

**Needles**

Size A (for Main Fabric)
One 16"" circular needle and one set of double-pointed needles (DPNs) in size needed to obtain gauge listed
Suggested Size: 4½ mm (US 7)

Size B (for Ribbing)
One 16"" circular needle, two sizes smaller than Size A
Suggested Size: 3¾ mm (US 5)

*32"" circular needle can be used instead of 16"" circular and DPNs if using the Magic Loop method for working small circumferences in the round.*

**Finished Dimensions**

15"" (38 cm) circumference unstretched; 7½"" (19 cm) length

Note: Hat is sized to fit head sizes ranging from 19-24"" circumference. Stitch pattern used is extremely stretchy. Although the unstretched dimensions for finished circumference given below appear small, the elasticity of finished fabric will fit head sizes listed above.

I used Cascade 220 Superwash since I intended this hat as a chemo hat.  If using a more dense yarn I suggest that a smaller needle size (6) be used.

As can be seen in the pictures of the two hats, the final choice of which yarn to end with creates a different center to the decrease.  Although the directions indicate cc, choice is yours.

The pattern includes options for adult small, medium, and large hats. I made myself a medium and it does run on the comfy/looser side, so size down if you prefer a more snug fit (the fit was perfect for me; no ribbing lines across this forehead!).

I would say the skill level for this particular hat is **intermediate**. If you are comfortable with decreasing stitches and using a cable needle, then you will do just fine.

About the design: 

The hat reminded me of water as I worked -  the color,  the fact that the yarn comes from a beautiful island, and the motif. It features offset cables, both textured and in simple twists. They are fun to work and easily memorized.  At the crown, I ended each repeat with a mix of shaping decreases and cables that creates a beautiful shape that reminds me of a large drop of water.  

The yarn this is worked in is Atlantic Worsted, from North Light Fibers, in the shade Teal Inlet.  It's a lovely, soft worsted merino. 

The hat is written in two sizes, and notes are included on how to modify for depth or width.  Cables are both charted and written. 

Note on Yardage:  If you are knitting the size L in the recommended yarn, note that you will use EVERY bit of your 170 yards of Atlantic.  To give yourself a little wiggle room, work 1-2 rounds less around the brim or combine Crown Rows 1-2 to decrease on every column of cables at the same time.  (I recommend getting an extra skein and then you can knit both sizes out of them!)

884249,Cacophony,Julie Hart,0.0,20.0,4.0,Rib,620.0,"Marled yarns are all the rage now. Create your own marled yarn in a Cacophony of color. The stripes or colorwash are created by holding 3 fingering yarns together as one. It is an easy technique that creates exciting knit fabrics.  One yarn will be carried throughout all rounds to create the marl and the other shades will be changed to create the stripes or the colorwash.  The color is the star here, so the stitch pattern is easy and relaxed. The number of shades is flexible.  You can use 2-10 shades of color. Dive into your stash for shades that match your favorite team, a new winter coat or remnants of a favorite project.  
Cacophony is ideal for gifting as it is easy to fit and offers a couple styling options.  The body is worked deep enough to allow a fold-back brim to keep those ears warm on particularly windy days.  It can also be worn down slouchy style.  The detailed hat crown finishes with a closure that makes it completely reversible. The pattern details 4 sizes from child to adult.

From the Smithsonian Magazine: Adult salmon live in the cold ocean, and both warming and acidification, now occurring because of global warming, are bad news for them. They eat and grow for up to four years, and then begin migrating back to their birth stream, fighting their way upstream to spawn. The female digs a nesting pocket in the gravel streambed to lay her eggs, while the male, fighting other males for the privilege, fertilizes them, after which they both die. 
The carcasses of spawned-out salmon bring a load of nutriments from the ocean back to otherwise nutrient-poor rivers. Bears, foxes, wolves, eagles, wrens and ravens feed on salmon flesh. Even salmon fry feed on the flesh of their parent generation. And salmon are sacred to many Indigenous people.
As well as navigational improvements—removing the snags the salmon need to provide pools for resting, industrial capitalism and its enterprises have wreaked havoc on the wild salmon of the Pacific Northwest. Loggers built splash dams, blocking a stream to build up a force of water, releasing it each day or week to shoot logs (and the streambed) downstream. Logging roads eroded hills and caused landslides; silt buried spawning gravel. Canneries wasted fish, driving salmon runs to extinction. Sawmills clogged streams with sawdust. Farmers and householders cleared land down to the water’s edge, and streams silted up and warmed up. Industry fouled the waters. Dams provided inadequate fish ladders or no fish ladders. The first hatchery was built in 1895, and early hatchery managers ignored fish biology even after it was understood.
In the Pacific Northwest, 19 populations of wild salmon and steelhead are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Salmon have already gone extinct in 40 percent of their historical range.

I find myself constantly drawn to mini skeins of yarn. They are such a great way to expand my range of colors and to meet new yarn dyers. I’m also always interested in how the same set of colors can take on a different appearance.

I began experimenting with a modular garter stitch construction using mini skeins and stumbled into this whimsical design. With multiple styling options, **COIN FLIP HAT** seemed like the perfect name to express this quality. Flip a coin to choose how to vary stripe width and colors. Flip the hat around for a different style. 

This hat is an equally great project to use a special mini skein set or to use up leftovers from other projects. This design is a blank canvas to create a unique lightweight hat for yourself or a friend. I can’t wait to see what you make.

This super bulky ‘Echo Beanie’ is a quick and beginner friendly project.  And it is much less complicated than it looks!  This beanie uses slipped stitches to get those bold vertical lines.  Since you will be alternating between two colors, you only knit with one color per round. I really loved seeing the two vertical columns knit up in contrasting colors.  Color B seems to mirror the stitches from color A, hence the ‘Echo’ name.  

I have included a few notes about sizing modifications and using more or less than two colors. Feel free to get creative with bold colors or even use lots of colors for a scrappy version. Also, with the two color
version, you will have enough yarn to make two beanies. I like to make the second one in reverse color order.

The Kindra Hat is the sister pattern to my Kindra Cowl. This twist on a traditional Nordic design was a way to play with color and use up scraps or mini skeins. It starts with a folded brim at the bottom and moves into a beginner friendly colorwork chart. You can choose a new color for each chart repeat or keep them all the same in order to fit your personal style. 

**NEEDLES**: 
Gauge Needle: Size US 5 (3.75 mm) 16"" circular needle for Adult/Child sizes, 32"" circular for magic loop for Newborn/Baby Sizes — or size necessary to obtain gauge. (Plus preferred method for small circumference knitting, DPNs or magic loop for top decrease).
Small Needle: Size US 4 (3.5 mm) 16"" - 32"" circular needle—one size smaller than Gauge Needle.

Based on tester feedback, this pattern is labeled easy/intermediate. I have linked video tutorials for the different techniques used, the entire pattern is color coded and there are charts for the colorwork or you can choose to follow the written colorwork instructions. I would not recommend this pattern to someone brand new to knitting, but if you are very comfortable with the basic stitches and can easily learn new techniques you should be able to make this hat.

*Techniques Used:*
Fair Isle Knitting (using 2 colors at once)

* Needles: 6mm (US 10) circular needles, either a 16 or 24 in (40 or 60 cm) cable length. 6mm (US 10) double pointed needles are optional for the crown shaping section. If you would like to use circular needles for the entire hat, you can always use the magic loop method.
* Yarn: 2 colors of bulky (#5) or heavy worsted (#4) weight yarn, I recommend using a wool or acrylic yarn. For best results at least one of the colors should be solid and the darker of the two colors should be used as color A. My sample is made with Petite wool in the the colors 'yarnicorn' and 'natural'.
            Color A: approx. 53 (64) 74 grams / 1.86 (2.25) 2.6 oz.

Little Pops Duo is a meditative knit with stockinette in the round interspersed with a slip stitch round that is easy to memorize and breaks up the knitting. 

This set can be made as a matching set to fit your winter wardrobe or switch it up and make them fraternal twins, change which color is the contrast and which one is the main color. 

The sample was made with a neutral color as the base and a barber poled gradient, a fun way to add hand spun or a similar yarn to your knit. Don't have a hand spun yarn? Use scraps or a variegated yarn as the contrast color!

1343398,Bird by Bird Hat,S. K. Hull,2.4,22.0,4.0,,219.0,"This hat pattern, with its bird-like slipped-stitch pattern, was inspired by Anne Lamott’s timeless book on writing and the writing life, *Bird by Bird*, and her father’s advice when faced with an enormous, seemingly insurmountable task:
 
“Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.”

This pattern is written for 70-180 meters (75 - 200 yards) of worsted weight yarn, but can be adapted for almost any weight by adjusting the number of cast on stitches to account for differences in gauge. 

This pattern will work well with solid, heathered and tonal yarns and those with a bit of halo or sheen. The textured slipped stitch pattern will also show off the colors in hand-dyed and variegated yarns.

The pattern is offered in six sizes, and can easily be adjusted by adding or omitting pattern repeats. 

This hat pattern is suitable for beginner knitters and the pattern offers sizes for the whole family from infant to adult.

It was inspired by the peaks and troughs visible on the water's surface, resulting in ripples. These small waves occur from a slight breeze or an object dropping into the water. The hat is knitted in the round, starting with a brim, and framed with a Latvian Braid for a unique touch. The main section of the hat is worked using the mosaic colorwork technique, which involves using only one color every two rounds. You'll have no trouble knitting this hat if you can knit in the round, slip stitches purlwise, and decrease stitches using K2tog.

I love the vertical stripes! *Weldon’s Practical Needlework*, vol. 3, p.14 pattern inspired me but it needed rewriting for a current yarn and current newborn head size. The large cuff provides room for growth. This pattern is recommended for intermediate knitters and adventurous beginners.
Hat is 6.5 inches tall and 14 inches around. I used Patons Kroy Sock colorway “Mexicala Stripes”.
The model is Dollmore’s Lusion ball-jointed doll.

Skills needed: any cast-on, knit, slip 1 stitch purl-wise, turning for short rows and bind off. 
	Provisional cast-on is optional; cast-on edge will be sewn to bind-off edge.

Gauge is important in this pattern. Use any yarn and needles that meet gauge. Make a swatch first to check gauge and appearance.

The easily memorized stitch pattern produces a wonderfully squishy and stretchy fabric to accommodate everyone in the family! You can easily modify this pattern by adjusting the brim and/or the length to give you a perfect fitting hat! 

**Construction**
Worked in the round from the bottom up starting with the brim. After working 2x2 ribbing to created a folded double brim, you will then begin working the body of the hat in the broken rib pattern repeat. As written the hat has a semi-slouchy fit but is easily modified to fit your personal preference.

**Needles & Notions**
-US4 / 3.5mm 16"" circular needle (or your preferred needle for working in the round) or size needed to obtain gauge.
-US4 / 3.5mm DPNS / long circular needle.
-8 Stitch markers (one being a unique BOR marker).
-Darning needle.
-Pom Pom (optional). 

**Yarn**

*Brim can be modified to a standard brim by only working ribbing for 1 (2, 2)"" / 3 (5, 5)cm (or your preferred length). 

*As written, the hat has a semi-slouchy fit. For a more fitted hat begin decreasing for the crown 1-2"" / 3-5cm sooner than called for in the pattern. ",5.0,12,3,0.0,"Small (Medium, Large)",DK

This collection includes Hats, Cowls, Mittens and Fingerless Mitts for all ages.
The patterns are available separately, or as a collection.  

For the matching Cowls, click [here][1].
For the matching Mittens and Mitts, click [here][2].

Finished Measurements:
Sizes: Toddler (Child S, Adult M, Adult L)
To Fit Head: 17-18 (19-20, 21-22, 23-24)"" / 43-46 (48-51, 53-56, 58-61) cm

Optional:  24-28 size 4/0 or larger beads

The Toddler and Child hats were knit using Madelinetosh Vintage in Laurel. One skein was used to knit both hats. The Toddler hat is shown with beads, the Child hat is shown with bobbles.

The Adult M and L hats were knit using Malabrigo Merino Worsted. The Adult M hat is shown in Burgundy with beads. The Adult L hat is shown in Continental Blue, and does not have any bead notes. I thought it looked a little more masculine with a plain staff. These examples are here to show you various options for your music hat!

The pattern comes with treble clef and bass clef charts, and written instructions. Only print the pages you need.

Because the music design is fairly subtle, it works best with a smooth, solid yarn. The design gets lost in a variegated or tweed yarn.

Feel free to PM me with questions or comments.

Happy Knitting!

The inspiration for this hat came to me during a crisp, evening run. I wanted a lightweight, comfortable beanie to throw on when heading out for a run or hike. I chose the arrow motif as a friendly reminder to push on. With the perfect amount of slouch and unique texture this is a great little hat to throw on anytime and looks great on both men and women! 

The instructions for the textured brim are both written and charted.

This pattern is mind-boggling by its simplicity, yet the finished look is sophisticated. 

The repetitive nature of the stitch pattern makes it soothing to the soul, and the short 2 rounds repeats mean it’s easy to remember (hello, TV knitting).


It is knit in the round from the bottom up. It's an easy hat with a traditional 2X2 ribbing, followed by a side braid, then a simple 2 rounds repeat reverse cross stitch until the decrease for the crown. This hat is youth and adult sized and is offered in 4 different sizing options. I recommend using a yarn that has a lot of lust and depth, to get the best out of the pattern. Indie-dyed yarns are best suited to make this pattern shine. 

This pattern was professionally tech edited and republished in 2021.

Level = Adventurous beginner

Notions you need to know: Casting on, knitting and purling, knitting and purling through the back loop, knitting 2 together through the back loop, knitting 2 stitches together, passing stitches over, placing markers, decreasing, binding off.

The color chart is 6 stiches wide, and is repeated 17 times per round.  The chart is 13 rows long and is only worked once.  This is the only chart used in this pattern, so this would be a great beginner colorwork project.

I suggest using US 5's for the brim, and then switching to US7's for the main body, but as the crown is worked, you will need to switch to one of the following methods: magic loop, 2 circulars, or a set of 3-5 dpns.  The two contrast colors needed are for the beer and the glass/border around the mugs.  I am not sure exactly how much yardage these areas will take, but I would say having 20yds of each is plenty.

The back of the hat is either completely plain, or you can run the bottom zigzag motif all the way around.  You can also repeat the main bead pattern so the back is beaded.  The Peerie version also has a tassel attached using a beaded twist cord.

The samples are knit in different yarns with different characteristics.  Angelic has a soft halo, MCS is tonal, and Peerie is smooth with a flat color.  Angelic and Peerie were the easiest for small bead placement.  The yardage used varies in the three samples, though each is the identical size.  

**Five sizes**
Extra Small (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large): ~17 (18, 19, 20, 21) inch circ. at widest point of hat by ~9” height.  The ribbing should be smaller in width.  Hats should have 2-3 inches of negative ease.  I have a 23 inch head and the large size fits very comfortably.  

**Gauge**
Gauge is important.  Please change needle size or hat size so you are satisfied with the results.

**Three Sizes of Beads Needed**
Beads shown in the samples are silver-lined seed beads, glass, in 3 sizes (sz 3/0, 6/0, 8/0).  Hook sizes are suggestions - use the hook size or bead method that works best for you.  The size 3 beads are hard to find.  Try here: [Garden of Beadin'][1].

**Techniques Used** 
Beadwork is charted only. Knitting, purling, adding beads. You will need to change to dpns to complete the crown shaping.

**About the Name**
The Ice Time Hat is inspired by my brother, Jeff—a hockey player in hisyouth and now coach to his son’s team. Jeff is only 20 months younger than me. When we were young, we were often mistaken for twins because of the resemblance but also because he was always there looking out for and protecting me. We were inseparable siblings (when we weren’t fighting like cats and dogs). The blending of the colors in this hat reminds me of that strong bond we share even as adults.

This ‘Reef Beanie’ uses a combination of slipped stitches and cable knitting to create a design that is very stretchy even with the thick yarn. The super bulky yarn makes for a very cozy and warm hat and a very quick knit as well.

This is a fitted style hat.  However, I included an option in the pattern if you would like to add more height/slouchiness to the hat. Just note that the yardage will increase.

Perfect for an adventurous beginner, or any knitter looking for a fun, quick project, Swivel is a great way to use up a skein of self-striping yarn, or a couple of leftover partial balls, striped together.

The pattern PDF includes two complete patterns, for two weights/gauges—the same construction and pattern concept, with different stitch and row counts.

For the Worsted Version, use either worsted weight yarn(s), fingering weight held double, or lace weight held triple.

The samples used two colorways of Knit Picks Chroma striped (two samples, one with slightly different gauge/sizing), Knit Picks Felici held double (two samples, one in one colorway, the other in two colorways), and Noro lace weight self-striping yarn held triple, [using this technique][1].

This hat is worked flat, from side to side, until it’s wide enough to fit around your head, at which point the beginning and ending edges are grafted or seamed together. The crown is shaped with short rows, the swivel is made with simple increases and decreases, and the stretchy brim is sideways garter stitch.

The shaping is made with short rows, which can be worked as basic wrap+turns, or using German short rows or another method of choice. The pattern allows the knitter to choose from a provisional cast-on or a standard cast-on, and from closing the hat with grafting, a 3-needle bind-off, or sewing the seam, making it a perfect pattern for learning some new techniques.

The pattern includes technique notes, with tutorials for provisional cast-on, German short rows, and grafting, details for how to work with multiple colors and sizing variations, and details about twelve sample hats.

**Yarn choice**
You may choose a yarn with built-in color changes; a self- striping yarn (longer color sections) will make swirling vertical stripes around the hat, whereas a variegated yarn (small color sections) will just make an overall swirling look without defined stripes. Or, create your own stripes/blocks by using two or more yarns and switching between colors.

**Sizing**
Size measurements are included, but the circumference is determined by when you stop working, so you can size yours as you knit by trying it on around your head—it should stretch around comfortably. All sizes have the same height, but height can be adjusted by slightly changing your gauge, or adding or subtracting stitches.

Color Pop Toque is a double brimmed knit hat with the first half of the brim worked in a contrasting color that just peeks over the folded edge. Of course the hat can also be knit up in one color. 

The pattern starts with a provisional cast on. One video I recommend for learning the provisional cast on with a crochet hook is by [Very Pink Knits. (Click here for the YouTube video.)][1] (no affiliation, I just enjoy her videos)

And [here’s a tutorial][2] of how to knit together from the live brim stitches to the provisional cast on edge for the double brim. [Kelbourne Woolens has a great photo tutorial][3] if you need it. (No affiliation, just a great tutorial.)

The toque uses approximately 200-225 yards (183-206 meters) of yarn. If you choose to color pop your brim, approximately 50-70 yards (46-69 meters) will be your contrasting color. It’s a great way to use up some of those small amounts of yarn left in your stash.

**Knitting Notions**

•Size 7 US/4.5mm 16”/40cm circular needles
•Another pair of the same or smaller circular needles for picking up provisional cast on stitches
•Crochet hook for provisional cast on
•Stitch marker
•Scrap yarn
•Ruler or Tape
•Tapestry or Darning needle
•Scissors  

**Stitches to Know**

•K knit
•SSK slip, slip, knit (Slip the next 2 stitches, one at a    time, knitwise onto right needle. Insert left needle into front of these 2 stitches and knit them together.)
•K2tog knit 2 stitches together

Pick your yarn, check your gauge, then enjoy the knit.

Yarns used in samples:

Camellia Fiber Co CFC Yak DK
West 7th Wool NSW DK
Brooklyn Tweed Quarry

Pattern Premise:
*Pushy friends? What are you talking about?*

*You know those friends - the ones that call you on your s&&t, that force you outside of your comfort zone, that make you challenge yourself, that build you up while making sure your ego always fits in the room.  This is for them.*  

*A little over three years ago, a friend of mine needed a quick 1x1 rib hat for bulky weight yarn and the one she liked that worked the lovely decreases while keeping the 1x1 rib going cleanly to the end, while shown on Ravelry, was no longer available for download.*  

*That means I got a text message ‘asking’ me to figure it out before she got to the decreases.  While I did not figure out the original pattern exactly (it was worked inside out), I did figure out how to make the decreases look the way she wanted.  I made a sample in DK at the same time, since I always have hats on my list of things to make, gave it to a friend and went on my merry way.  She finished her bulky version, gave it to a friend, and then the pestering began.*

*Well three years later, firmly in hat mode again for the second year in a row, combined with new yummy DK yarn at two of my favorite LYSes, I’m finally caving to my pushy friends and writing this up for the rest of you.*  

*It’s more of a recipe since it works with any weight of yarn, as long as you know your gauge.  Just follow the rules and work something up for yourself and one of your own pushy friends as thanks for keeping you going while at the same time keeping you grounded.  I would not be where I am without them.*

1288104,Ring Around the Rosie Beanie,Sandra A James,2.33,,,stockinette,140.0,"Description:
You don't have to be an expert knitter to make this stylish basic beanie with easy textured or bobbled panels, worked in the round on circular needles. One size fits most adult/teens but pattern is easily adapted to different sizes by adding/subtracting 8-stitch repeats. Using only knit, purl, and optional bobble stitch that is completed in one round, this beanie knits up quickly, especially with bulky or super bulky yarn. It's a perfect candidate for market prep, not to mention, it results in the classic, traditional, squishy hat that looks good with or without a pompom on just about anyone! 

Pattern is written in US terms for worsted, light bulky, bulky and super bulky weight yarn. Pattern also includes a choice of templates with written and charted instructions for the panel sections between the rings, giving you so many styling options. And, beanie looks great with or without a pompom because of the attractive crown, which is more puckered the lighter the weight! Share your creations with family and friends. It makes the perfect gift, though, don't forget to make one for yourself too! 

One size fits most teen-adults. Beanie fits approximately 20-22"" head circumference.

Skill level:
Moderately easy pattern that you make yourself, using primarily knit and purl stitches. Suitable for knitters with only a little experience, this pattern also includes a video tutorial for the bobble stitch technique for those who would like to include bobbles in their design. Pattern is knit in one piece, in the round, from the bottom up on circular needles.

""U"" for university! Use your hat to show your love for your school or team. Stripe U is the perfect hat to wear to the game or just around town. 

Super-stretchy ribbing makes this hat super comfortable to wear. The pattern includes sizing for kids and adults, so you can make this quick-to-knit  hat for the whole family. And you'll be surprised by how little yarn is required, even for the largest size. 

**Sizes**: Child approximately age 3 - 10 (adult small, adult medium, adult large) with finished circumference approximately 11 (12, 13.5, 15)”/ 27.5 (30, 34, 37.5) cm. This is a **very stretchy** hat! These sizes will fit someone of head circumference approximately 14-18 (16-22, 18-24, 20-26)”/35-45 (40-55, 45-60, 50-65) cm.

**Gauge:**  22 sts and 20 rounds to 4”/10 cm in pattern stitch of *k2, p2*

**Yarn:**  Fingering/sock-weight yarn in two colors:

* Main color: approximately 25 (28, 33, 38) grams/ 130 (140, 155, 175) yards/125 (135, 150, 165) meters 
* Contrast color: approximately 5 (7, 10, 14) grams/ 25 (35, 45, 55) yards/25 (35, 45, 55) meters 

The yarn used for the sample was Lolodidit Loriginal, a blend of 85% wool/ 15% nylon with 440 yards/100 grams. Other wool or wool-blend yarns would also work well.

**Needles:**  US 3/3.25 mm, or size to obtain gauge. 
This hat is worked in the round. A 16""/40 cm circular needle will be comfortable for adult small – adult large. For the child size, you will need either a 12""/30 cm circular needle, double-pointed needles, or a much longer circular needle, if you prefer the Magic Loop method. 
All sizes will need dpns/Magic Loop as the number of stitches decreases at the crown of the hat.

**Notions:** Marker for beginning of round + 3 additional markers; tapestry needle.

**Questions as you go?** My email is in the pattern.

***ERRATA:** The pdf of this pattern has been updated (as of 11/29/07) If you have a version of the pattern that is missing the info for the larger size -- instead of knitting the hat to a length of 5"" before the decreases, knit to 6"". The brim of the hat is pretty elastic, but older babies will need increased depth. For the size printed, 5"" will work for newborns, but to ensure the baby can wear it into its third or fourth month, 5.5"" would be better.*

When I got there, I was horrified to learn that, a) they were going out of business and, b) they had already sold off most of their stock.

Undaunted, I pawed through the sale bins, elbowing more than a few bargain hunters in the process, until I came across the perfect yarn. Great colors: check. Machine washable: check. Merino wool: a bonus! But only one or two balls of each color remained, and they were going fast.

No time to choose a pattern or decide which shades would go well together. I just scooped them all up and ran, determined to do something spontaneous and creative once I got home.

Although six different colors are specified for the hat, you won't come close to using them up. By combining the colors in various ways, you could get as many as five or six hats out of the six balls of yarn, depending on the size(s) chosen.""",,224,252,4.41,0-3 months,Bulky

404847,Roosevelt Park,Kara McKinley,1.89,18.0,4.0,Stockinette Stitch,150.0,"The Roosevelt Park Hat (formerly called Raven’s Preseason Hat) is a quick little project that uses increasingly short stripes to create a cool graphic look (I love patterns where it looks like you’ve done something fancy and complicated, but all you’re really doing is something a simple as striping two colors of yarn). Plus, you carry the yarn up inside the hat which means you have just 4 ends to weave in when done knitting.

This pattern was originally published on my blog in August 2012 as one size. I've updated the pattern to include three sizes:

* Small: 16"" circumference by 7"" height which stretches to fit an 18-19"" head.

Ah, the magic of mistake rib – it's worked in the soothing rhythm of K2/P2 ribbing but an extra stitch 'oopses' the next row over by one, giving you a much more complex texture than the simple ribbing instructions imply. Knit in a classic worsted weight or luxurious chunky, this set is cozy and modern.

This hat features a deep brim in 2x2 ribbing that is worn folded back, and a geometric colourwork motif that continues through the crown decreases. An optional tubular cast-on and jaunty pompom provide polished finishing touches. Work the ribbing in the main colour and the pompom in the contrast to emphasise the gradient effect, or invert them for a bigger graphic punch.

Fun and fast knit.  Great cables without a cable needle.  There are lots of options to make this your own personal hat.  The mock cables provide great stretchiness for a perfect fit.  

Play with color options and make it in seasonal or school colors.  Work it in DK or Light Worsted or carry a double strand of Sport weight.  Add a pom pom.

This is a great use for stash or leftover yarn from sweater projects!  

Block hat open to measurements or make it one size larger and leave it unblocked and stretchy for an extra cushy and comfortable fit.

Self-shading Poems makes this addictive colorwork hat shine. Sized baby through adult, this hat makes the perfect selfish project or a quick gift. Baby size is shown in Wisdom Yarns Poems color Chevron 616 and Universal Yarn Deluxe Worsted Superwash color 715 Teal Viper. 

This hat is worked in the round from the bottom up. Color changes are achieved through the stranded method of knitting. You may wish to place a stitch marker between each pattern repeat. Use a contrast color marker to distinguish the beginning of the round from pattern repeat markers. ¬

This pattern uses the 1x1 long-tail tubular cast-on method for a neat edge. There are many tutorials available online for this technique. If in doubt, use another stretchy cast-on technique.

**Pattern #17 in the original U.S. National Park inspired line of beanies** 
by Nancy Bates

From diving and kayaking to hiking and camping, it’s the landscapes above and below the water that draw thousands of adventurous visitors to these amazing islands off the coast of southern California each year.  Wildflowers in the spring add even more color and dimension to the already stunning views. This beanie (worked in the round from the bottom up) uses subtly textured stitches and the beautiful colors of the sea and the land to create a stylized landscape that’s fun to knit…and fun to wear!

I obviously draw so much inspiration from this particular type of pottery and admire the curves, bold black lines against the white clay and the subtle pops of color. Everyone needs a  great beanie to wear on those cold morning walks as the sun is still warming up the land . I named my Collection Shik'is (my Friend) because I'd love for you to make and gift any of these patterns to a loved one, a new friend, or your family members over this season.

982952,Tracks,Pam Grushkin,4.75,22.0,4.0,Herringbone Stitch,140.0,"When I look at the herringbone stitch, I see tracks - could be tracks in the snow, ski tracks, tire tracks, or even bird tracks. It's an interesting textured stitch that creates a nice dense fabric for the brim of a hat.

I especially love how the herringbone brim hugs the ears and keeps you warm. 

The brim is knit flat and begins with reverse stockinette border, continues with the herringbone stitch and then joins in the round with a reverse stockinette border.  The rest of the hat is knit in the round. To finish, the brim is seamed.

Once size fits most adults with head circumference of approximately 21”-23”, the hat has negative ease and stretches to fit comfortably.

It is a fairly quick knit and would be suitable for women and men.

I have a live recorded class, teaching this pattern, available for purchase on my [website][1]. 

This pattern was initially designed for Knitting Central and Cynthia Crescenzo.

A couple of months ago, I created a lovely shawl using pink, mustard and cream colored yarns. I used up all of the pink, but had enough of the yellow and cream to make a beanie. I got to work, searching Pinterest for inspiration and found a brioche beanie using the star stitch. I thought it would be perfect, but I didn't have enough yarn for the brioche technique, so I wrote this pattern. Enjoy!

Mauna: Mountain. The triangles in this hat symbolize mountains to me; strung together, and going in either direction, they also signify people, family, past and future. The curving negative spaces remind me of waves of water, of echoes, and rainbows. All of these together spell one word: Home.

Hat is worked from brim to crown in the round, beginning with a ribbed brim and Latvian braid, followed by stranded colorwork motifs. Slouchy and Beanie versions are worked in the same manner through the ribbing and Latvian braid. Colorwork Charts specific to each version should then be followed when specified in the pattern. Crown shaping is worked the same for both versions, all sizes.

Determine your main color for the fingering weight marled hat version and accent it by adding in two contrast colors, or use one main color throughout the hat for the DK version. 

This hat is knit from the foldable brim toward the crown. Can be worn with a bit of extra fabric at the top for slouch, or worn snug to keep your head nice and toasty! A soft and squishy yarn like Twisted Ambitions Yarn Wicked DK or Sweet Sock will make the coziest hat. 

The Hip N' Slip hat finished measurements after blocking: 21"" / 53cm head circumference.

The hat comfortably stretches to fit up to a 23” / 58cm head circumference. For a more relaxed fit on a larger head size, I recommend aiming for a gauge of 22 – 24sts = 4” / 10cm in Slip Stitch pattern.

Definitely not a sweater’s worth of anything, let alone a shawl’s worth or a pair of socks. You can’t imagine what to do with them, but you don’t want to throw them away. Well, I’m no different; Kathy Elkins of WEBS sent me a box of yarn to swatch. It stared at me reproachfully and demanded my respect: riches of wool, silk, alpaca and other blends. And an idea kept niggling at my mind (for a couple of years, no less). And so I finally gave in.

This is my project: to use this box of yarn and to respect the fiber. The rules are simple: I use what’s in the box, no matter the weight and the color, no matter what the fiber content is (luckily for me, there’s some really nice stuff). I can add buttons and other little embellishments, but that’s it. I may not go out and buy other yarn or beg Kathy for anything else. I have 18 balls of yarn and my imagination. There will be 15-18 projects. Some will be easy to dream up. Others? Not so much! But fun knitting for you, all the same!

All patterns will have charts (if needed) and written instructions, and you will be able to make them out of oddments. These are small projects, not big ones: the perfect size for an evening or two of knitting in front of the fire or sitting on the porch sipping a lemonade! So...knitters: pull out those oddments!

**Liab**
A classic cabled beanie worked from the bottom up in an easy but interesting pattern. A dense gauge combines with slipped stitches and cables to create a richly textured, very warm fabric. The long length works as a slouchy beanie, or fold the ribbed band up for a classic watch cap — and cosy ears. Decreases are worked into the stitch pattern at a relatively rapid rate for a slightly gathered effect at the crown that works equally well with or without the optional pom-pom.

125\[200, 240] yds / 115\[180, 220]m
The yardage given does not include the optional pom-pom, which will take approximately 35m depending on diameter. 
The suggested yarn has not been washed before spinning and will bloom when the spinning oil is removed. It’s described as a dk but after washing feels closer to an aran or heavy worsted. A standard dk yarn can be used but won’t create such a thick, cushy fabric.

She epitomized elegance and glamour, but was known for her artistic creativity, and down to earth personality. She was the world's first super model, but described herself as a ""good clothes hanger"" After marrying photographer Irving Penn in 1950 they worked together until 1960 when she retired from modelling and became a successful sculptor.

**About the Name**

The stitch pattern in the 103 Hat has reminded me of ladders ever since my very swatch. As a member of Local 103 IBEW  (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) here in Boston, my sweetheart, Dan, is up and down ladders every day, running telecommunication lines for factories and businesses in Massachusetts. IBEW provides generous health benefits for its employees and supports local and national charities. 

I love the synergy of this ladder pattern with the intent of the Cast On Collaborative’s December of Designers to bring awareness to mental health support and to raise funds. The profits of the first day’s sales of this pattern will be donated to National Alliance on Mental Illness Massachusetts. Sometimes we all need support and encouragement to take just one more step up onto the next rung of the ladder. Together, we can keep climbing!  

On December 28, 2019 100% of the profits (after Ravelry and PayPal fees) were donated to the [National Alliance on Mental Health Massachusetts][1] Thank you to everyone who helped us to raise $337 for donation

Encircling your head like a woolly crown, the Simple Colorwork Slouch Hats use two colors for a repeated zig-zag motif with playful clusters at the points and dotted in-between. A snug ribbed brim, slightly slouchy shape, squishy structure, and simple finishing all combine to make these hats super cozy and quick to knit!

We chose Wool and the Gang’s Alpachino Merino for the Simple Colorwork Slouch Hats. A chunky-weight blend of sustainably sourced alpaca and merino, this yarn has a gently, poofy twist and creates a plush and cozy fabric. And with a color palette that features both playful brights and calm neutrals, there are so many fun combo options! Plus, you just need two skeins of Alpachino Merino for two colorwork hats, alternating the main color and contrasting color.

The stitch pattern is simple but so much fun to work, and the pattern is beginner-friendly.  This is a great way to show off highly variegated or speckled yarns, but the texture works well with solids and tonals, too.

The Aspenglow Biggie hat looks good with or without a pompom and works for both men and women.  The pattern includes four sizes so you can knit this hat for the whole family.

Instructions in this pattern include deconstructing a professional league baseball, as well as cleaning and preparation before knitting.  The wool can be a bit rough, so it is suggested to use a good wool wash and a quarter cut of hair conditioner to a gallon of water to help soften before drying.

Adding a fleece lining once complete will help make it more wearable, softer, and warmer.  There are numerous options on how to do this on YouTube, depending if you want to sew the liner yourself, or use a store bought fleece hat already constructed.

Several years back, I wanted to put a whopping big cable on a [sock pattern][4] – but I had to solve the problem of the cable pulling in and making the socks too small to fit over the heel, so I incorporated hidden increases and decreases to make it all work.

Now I’ve finally given into the temptation of putting that cable somewhere more visible – my head. This extremely stretchy hat is a comfort to wear. It hugs the head without putting it in a death vise! Everyone will be sure to Take Notice of the ribbing that does a little cable dance, then gets back to the business of being ribbing.

Enjoy this first offering in the [2022 Head to Toe with Kino and Jo Knitalong][5]!


**What Testers Had to Say:**
* ""I loved the simplicity of the pattern - but the wow factor of the cable knot.""
* ""It's a beautiful pattern and it reveals itself--it's a complex pattern comprised of fairly straightforward components. It's like reading a mystery and you want to see the end.""
* ""I loved that there was a written and charted pattern and that both were well formatted. The increases hidden throughout the cable section was a super unique way to incorporate cables into a stretchier item and was still really easy to understand and follow.""
* ""I just appreciated the creativity and how many sizes you included! One size does not fit all for hats, so seeing many hat sizes with advice on choosing the right fit was great!""

**Skills:**
* knitting and purling in the round (ribbing)
* 2x1 and 2x2 cables
* K2tog, P2tog, P2tog tbl, and SSK decreases

The Baby Bunny Hat is perfect for a bunny-themed photoshoot featuring your favorite little one! I was asked by a dear friend if I could create such a hat for her newborn rainbow baby. Of course, I jumped at the opportunity and the Baby Bunny Hat came to be! This hat knits up so quick and is delightfully squashy in a DK yarn.

The hat comes in sizes Newborn, 0-3 Months, 6 Months, 9-12 Months, 1-3 Years, 4-6 Years, and 7-10 Years. The hat is knit first in the round, with instructions written for the Magic Loop Method. Then, each inner ear and outer ear is knit flat, seamed, and finally attached to the hat where purl stitches mark the placement.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: I cannot give pattern support in relation to seaming on this pattern. This is an intermediate pattern and you should be comfortable with seaming prior to knitting it. Thank you for understanding!**

1298384,Mayflower Hat,Grace White,1.71,5.0,1.0,Stockinette,400.0,"I created this hat to look great in all of those crazy rainbow colored variegated skeins and to show off all the beautiful pom-poms! I also created this hat to be flexible enough to either use DK, worsted, or two fingering yarns held together. (Note: Deep purple pom-pom hat shown is an example of a hat made with 2 fingering yarns held together. The gold pom-pom hat is an example made in DK yarn.) Holding the two strands of fingering yarn together will help to break up the pooling that naturally happens with variegated yarns in patterns with decreases. Some knitters may really like this aspect.

The Pattern includes some detailing on the crown to draw the eye up to the pompom. The purl ridge stitching is great for beginner knitters and it adds nice shaping to the top of the hat. Most knitters should be able to complete this project in a few days, or sittings.

I came up with the name ""Mayflower Hat"" from a convergence of sentimental things: I have a favorite beach with this name and I was making this hat to debut a super big yarn festival in May, as well as the purl ridge stitching that makes a bit of a flower on the crown. Enjoy!! :)

*The Snowbird hat, knit in the round with a light, lofty yarn and luxurious all-over cables, is a fluffy hat that will keep away the chill. The cable pattern resembles a flock of birds flying to warmer climates for the winter. You can pick one of three sizes: small (medium, large). Small is intended to fit a toddler or small child. Medium should fit large children and small adults. Large is intended to fit most adults.*

*Badgerface Fiber WAM is a thick and thin yarn between DK and worsted weight in a blend of Minnesota Cheviot wool, milled with alpaca and mohair to give it luster. The mohair blooms, creating a soft halo in the finished product, and the strength of the wool reduces chances of pilling. The yarn is milled on the Get Bentz Farm cottage-size woolen mill, and all yarn is sourced locally. If you’re substituting yarn, pick a DK (or light worsted) weight yarn with a slight halo.*

1306701,Slip Up Beanie,Sara Hemsath,0.0,30.0,4.0,"k1, P1 Rib",166.0,"Slip Up Beanie is the second pattern in a three pattern “progressive knitting” series. This pattern takes a skill that was introduced in Lift A Twist Beanie and adds on an additional knitting element. The original skill introduced is doing a k1, p1 left twist without the need of a cable needle, or having to release live stitches off the needles. While each pattern can stand alone, and the technique is taught in all, they can be knitted altogether as a fun progression, or independently. This pattern is called Slip Up because the additional technique is slipping stitches to create a diagonal line, instead of a spiral (like in Lift A Twist). 

Skill Level
Intermediate/Advanced Intermediate: Knowledge of cables and twisted stitches is helpful to understand the special left twist technique used for this pattern.

A New Take on the double layered reversible beanie in which there are so many versions out there, here is to them all.

A New Take on the double layered reversible beanie, unlike our original ANT in baby yak lace ([found here][1]). I have added STRIPES and made this on in baby yak Medium weight yarn. A unisex hat which is a quick knit in the medium thus the perfect gift giving item.

CONSTRUCTION
This hat is reversible and can be worn as a slouch hat or the brim folded to wear as a beanie and show off both sides. The hat uses square crown shaping, the “+” shape on the A side and pinwheel shaping on the B side. Using color A, the hat is worked from the brim to the crown starting with a provisional cast on, then using Color B, the live stitches of Color A are picked up and from there the hat is striped with Color A and B through the pinwheel shaping. Ends are woven in before beginning the crown of Color B. This hat utilizes 2 colors and 3 skeins of mYak baby yak medium.  If you choose to use only 2 skeins of baby yak medium you run the risk of playing yarn chicken unless you have EXACT gauge.

GAUGE
20 stitches x 28 rounds = 4” / 10cm

YARN
mYak Baby Yak Medium 50 grms / 128 yrds / 117 mt or any heavy dk / Lt worsted weight yarn

SAMPLE
Color A 2 skeins of mYak baby yak medium in Toffee / Shine 220 yrds / 201 mt
Color B 1 skein of mYak baby yak medium in Sweet Kiss / Aqua Green 80 yrds / 73 mt

TOOLS
Adjust needle size if necessary to obtain correct gauge.
Suggested Size US 6/4.5 mm 16 in/40 cm circular needle and set DPN’s or long circular needle for magic loop method

***In Regards to Working in the Round:***
Knitting a hat requires a wide range of circumferences to accommodate the body of the hat and the crown as it decreases. This means it is helpful to either have lots of different length needles, use the magic loop method of going in the round, or use double pointed needles. The pattern assumes the maker will use their favorite method, changing needle styles when and if needed.

***People are always asking me about my favorite styles and I'd have to say: this one could be it!***

Since I've made mine, it's been on me outside almost everyday in the windy December chills.

A certain sassy attitude with the little bit of slouch to the cap; a certain fashion sensibility that mirrors the trends around town; and the wearability and warmth all add up to W.I.N.

The Super Cupcake series features various types of ribbing to get its fit using popular worsted weight yarns -- the poof of the top of the hat over the tighter ribbed band reminds us of one of our most favorite festive treats!

For a real scrumptious look, make the *frosting* out of some kid silk blended yarn...

We did knit it originally in Shibui Worsted, one in the colors of a foggy San Francisco Day and one with black for a San Francisco Night.  This yarn has since been discontinued.  In February 2016, we added additional chart options and sizing to the pattern.  Almost all of our samples are knit out of Madelinetosh Vintage or Malabrigo Rios but use your favorite worsted or aran yarn. Works great for sports fans too.",6.0,225,89,4.67,adult,Worsted

248900,Zombie Killer Slouch,Luciana (Young) DeVito,1.69,12.5,4.0,stockinette on size 10 (6.0mm) needles,160.0,"Some bulky weight yarns are much loftier than others, so do check your gauge before starting. It's bulky, gauging will be accomplished quickly ;o) .... If you need to reduce # of c.o. stitches, remember to reduce by multiple of 2.

Recently we watched the hilarious movie Zombieland on TV. I don't know why we hadn't heard of it before, it's a RIOT! Needless to say, when I saw the character Little Rock's simple slouch I immediately searched for some pattern like it. Found some which were close, but not close enough. So I made up my own. I wrote down the easy pattern and it's yours free. Enjoy! It's a fast 1-2 day knit on bulky weight yarn. If you use a super bulky yarn, I recommend reducing the C.O. to 68 stitches, so that the extra weight of the hat doesn't make it slip off your head.
