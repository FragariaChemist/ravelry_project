150257,Saroyan,L Abinante,2.52,16.0,4.0,stockinette,370.0,"Saroyan is the third pattern in a series inspired by the television show Bones. Previous patterns include [Traveling Woman][1] and [Temperance][2].

Dr. Camille Saroyan is intelligent, graceful, and uncompromisingly organized. The simple lace scarf would fit right at home in sleek and professional wardrobe.

Knit in one piece from start to finish, Saroyan is a perfect project for beginning lace knitters. This tapered scarf can be worn a variety of ways, and the construction helps to keep your neck nice and cozy. The lace edging used in this scarf is from a stitch dictionary titled Super Stitches Knitting. A garter stitch border rolls over nicely, so you only see the stocking stitch body and lovely lace edging. (This rolling can be prevented if desired.)

Much like Traveling Woman, this pattern is easily adjusted to your preference. Like the triangular shawl shape instead? Simply knit more repeats of the increase section, and then begin your decreases immediately. Prefer fingering weight yarn? Bust out your scale and weigh your yarn periodically.

Don't be afraid to be bold with this pattern. It can be knit in almost any yarn weight in practically any size. The increase, decrease, and straight sections are designed so that they can be easily added or subtracted to the pattern.

The worsted weight sample shown has 6 increase repeats, 10 straight repeats, and 6 decrease repeats (22 leaves total). Each repeat will give you one leaf. I had less than 5 grams of yarn left when finished.

**Errata**

(1) For pages 3/4 (charts): Wherever it says “rhn” in the symbol descriptions, it should actually read “lhn” - this is in the description for all the bind-offs in rows 4 (left leaf) and 9 (right leaf).

(2) In the written directions, it says ""you have used 1/2 your yarn"" and instructs you to begin decreases. However, if you are following the schematic you will see that decreases begin after you have used 72.5% of your yarn. You can start decreases anywhere in the pattern, as long as you have approximately 30% of your yarn left to complete the decrease section. (if you made an extra-large increase section, you must be sure to have the same quantity of yarn remaining that you used for the increase section).

*RIPTIDE135 - The story:* Whilst kicking off a tennis match this summer, I tore two calf muscles leaving me on crutches for almost four weeks. Thank goodness I could knit! I’d seen so many scans and diagrams and these strips of broken and unbroken knitting were, to me, the rips in my muscles. I was going to call it “Let Rip” but the colour of this gorgeous yarn kept pulling me to the sea, and thus, it became Riptide. This shawl was pure therapy! 
The 1-3-5 refers to the different shawl options and sizes available in this pattern. There are instructions for 1, 3, or 5 skeins of yarn.

**Riptide 1 | 1 Skein | narrow scarf **
**Riptide 3 | 3 Skeins | medium sized shawl**
**Riptide 5 | 5 Skeins | large sized shawl **
Please see schematic and sizes in photo.

> The samples are knit using the
> luxurious **Crave Caravan DK** yarn by
> Yarn Culture. Check out this fabulous
> yarn [**HERE**][3].

**CONSTRUCTION:**
Riptide 1 is knit tip to tip, and Riptide 3 and 5 are each worked from the tip on the right out to the left edge, producing asymmetrical shawls. Increases are worked on the RS row throughout. The neat smooth edges envelop strips of simple increases and decreases producing a chain like textured pattern that rips through the stocking stitch - ode to my ripped muscles ;)

**YARN:**
Crave Yarn, Caravan DK, 100g (210m/ 230 yds, 70% Superwash Extrafine Merino, 10% Cashmere, 10% Camel, 10% Mulberry silk).
Riptide 5: Shawl sample colourway in Idyll.
Riptide 1: Scarf sample colourway in Meditation.

Yarn required: 
Riptide 1: 1 Skein, 100g (210m/ 230 yds) 
Riptide 3: 3 Skeins, 300g (630m/ 690 yds)
Riptide 5: 5 Skeins, 500g (1,050m/ 1,150 yds).

**NEEDLES & NOTIONS**
- Size 4.0mm / US 6 circular needle, 100 cm / 40” length (or size needed to obtain gauge) for shawl.

23 sts x 32 rows = 10cm x 10cm (4”x 4”) in stocking stitch with larger needle, after blocking.

947400,A Good Scarf,Barbara Benson,1.74,10.0,2.0,Garter,,"Sometimes you just want something easy to knit. A pattern that is fast to memorize; a project that you can pick up and put down without fear of losing your place. Believe it or not, designing something that checks all of these boxes while at the same time yielding something that is visually enticing is a significant challenge. But I think I managed it with this scarf.

It’s one row. Seriously. Once you get that one row down you are good to go. And somehow this one row produces a scarf that is completely reversible! With a few simple stitches you can create something that is
more than the sum of its parts.

There is [A Matching Hat][2] for this piece!

I chose to knit the sample in DK weight yarn but this pattern will work equally well in Sport or Worsted weight. If you choose a different weight yarn you will need to adjust your yardage and needle size appropriately.

For Sport weight you'll need to go down a needle size and stick with 2 skeins, although you'll probably not use all the yarn. The scarf will be narrower.

For Worsted weight you'll need to go up a needle size and most likely will need 3 skeins. The scarf will be wider. 

Stitches Used: knit, purl slip, slip with yarn in front
Optional bind off uses k2tog and p2tog

>
>One question I get a lot is about the k2togs at the end of the wrong-side rows in the Right Side Triangle. The k2tog decrease in the pattern is the correct decrease (Staci works a p2tog in the above video). The k2tog decrease results in a kind of garter stitch edging along the side of the scarf (almost like little bumps running up the sides). Those little bumps are created in the Left Side Triangle by knitting the first stitch of all of the wrong-side (purl) rows.
>
>If you don't want the garter stitch edge you can purl the first stitch of every wrong-side row of the Left Side Triangle and then do a p2tog at the end of every wrong-side row of the Right Side Triangle.
>
>So the choice is really up to you as to which look you prefer, but once you decide on “bumps” or “no bumps”, you just need to be consistent and make that change in BOTH side triangles so that you don’t end up with bumps down one side of the scarf and no bumps down the other!

Students at Hogwarts show their house pride in a variety of ways: earning house points, cheering for their team at Quidditch games, and of course, wearing their house colors. Among the most popular pieces of house-themed apparel are the classic house scarves.

This design is worked in the round from the bottom up with no purling. The easy tubular construction means there’s no wrong side and the length is easy to adjust. The clean jogless stripes give this scarf a classic prep-school feel and quick fringe decorates both edges for a playful touch. Whether you’re a Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin, a house scarf is a must-do project for any knitter who’s ever dreamed of going to Hogwarts.

Scarves use 5 hanks of MC and 2 hanks of CC.

The Betangled Shawlette is a fully reversible, crescent-shaped shawlette featuring two cables curving around a garter-stitch field.  It is knitted sideways, from one tip to the other.  A short-row section in the center creates triangular wedges in the garter field, shaping the shawlette into a crescent.

This versatile piece can be draped loosely around the shoulders or fastened in place by pulling one of the leafy ends through any cable crossing.

**Ends:**  The nature of this design requires a lot of slipping stitches to move the design towards the center and/or back out again depending on which variation you choose to knit. Because of this, you could need to sew in a number of ends after the piece is complete. You can however choose to sew them in as you go and/or work with bobbins for color sections to cut down on how many ends you will have after completion of the design.

Seriously though, Gneiss Scarf is worked tip to tip with a simple lace border going up the straight edge of the scarf. Optional beads are placed at the center of the lace motif. The Scarf is written for two sizes and is easily adjustable to make bigger or smaller.

I knit my Gneiss in Garthenor Organic Number 1. Number 1 is a woolen-spun single ply naturally colored organic lace yarn. Garthenor is breed specific and can trace each skein of yarn back to the flock that produced the wool. 

Errata: Row 23 of the Gneiss End CHART there is an extra k2tog that shouldn't be there in the 4th square from the right. The rev1 update has deleted it. The written directions are correct.

Alex's perfect airplane project (both to knit and to wear!) is a sheer tube of lace-weight mohair you can style any number of ways.

There is just something utterly addicting about knitting together tiny, bright skeins of sock weight yarn, watching the shades shift below your fingertips as the strands form new and glorious color combinations. Knit this scarf by using up all those little bits of leftover yarn you’ve been saving like a dragon guarding its hoard, or collect more from others. Then make it yours by knitting it big or little, fat or skinny, in a random cacophony of color or with a subtle, ordered transition. 

This scarf uses the eponymous fabric stitch, or linen stitch, so named because it looks similar to a woven linen fabric. The stitch uses simple slipped stitches to create a dramatic finished project and is knit lengthwise to most accurately replicate the style of a woven garment. After receiving many requests from others asking how mine was made, I decided to share the method to my madness. Now you can learn how to duplicate my results to achieve a truly maniac scarf.

Worked from the bottom up, this scarf works up fairly quickly using worsted weight yarn and size 10 1/2 needles. A simple repeat in the pattern makes this fairly mindless - a great car project.
My finished scarf was approximately 82"" x 10"".

This pattern was fully tested by a great team of testers here on Ravelry.

I didn't even block mine, just lightly steamed the stockinette/reverse stockinette stripes to get them to lay a bit flatter.

As with all my patterns, feel free to make and sell as many as you'd like.

The shawl can be knit in a variety of yarn weights with the appropriate needle size to create your desired drape. I have knit the shawl in both fingering and worsted weight yarns with lovely results. Circular needles work best to accommodate the ever increasing number of stitches. In most cases, the shawls required 400-450 yards of yarn. 

This is a perfect one-skein project for many fingering and sock weight yarns.

""One Skein Wonder"" is a delightful and simple project that showcases the beauty of variegated yarn. This easy-to-follow pattern creates a stunning scarf worked from corner to edge, highlighting the color changes in the skein on the bias. While any yarn can be used, a variegated skein is highly recommended to truly appreciate the vibrant hues as they stripe and pool throughout the scarf. With just basic knitting skills required, this project is perfect for beginners and seasoned knitters alike. Unleash your creativity and enjoy the mesmerizing color play with the ""One Skein Wonder"" scarf.

SIZES
One Size – Length: 60 inches (152.5 cm) – Width: 19 (48 cm)

MATERIALS
Yarn: Socks that Rock Heavyweight by Blue Moon Fiber Arts, a 4-ply superwash, 100% merino hand dyed yarn. Estimated requirement: 350 yards – 320 meters, or a total of 1 – 198 g skeins. The model is knitted in two colorways “Royal” and “Crackle Crackle Pop”. Notions: Stitch markers, tapestry needle.

GAUGE
18 stitches and 36 rows to 4 inches (10 cm) in garter stitch on US 9 (5.5 mm) needles. While gauge is not as important for a shawl as for a sweater, yarn substitutions and inconsistent gauge will affect overall size and amount of yarn required.

This pattern is suitable for beginner knitters. Directions for all stitches are well-defined in the Abbreviations and Definitions section of the pattern.

88779,Pioneer Braid Scarf,Catherine Ryan,2.23,18.0,4.0,Garter stitch,350.0,"This easy garter stitch short row pattern is inspired by Karen Baumer’s Multidirectional Diagonal Scarf, with a twist.

Although the scarf pattern looks wonderful in self-striping or long-color-repeat yarns, it is also a great choice for hand-dyed variegated yarns, as the varying row lengths will tend to break up pooling.  Even semi-solid yarns are subtly shown off by the pattern.   Twisted Fiber Art's ""long repeat"" Duchess would be an excellent substitute for a similar look.

The pattern gives suggestions for adapting to lighter or heavier weight yarns, or for changing the size.  Use the recommended needle size for your yarn, adapted to your knitting style and drape desired.

The name ""Pioneer Braid"" was inspired by a quilting pattern of the same name.

The pattern was modified 1/31/2010 for a more elegant ending that uses less yarn.

Crafted from 1 skein of CaMaRose Lovetand yarn, this scarf features a stitch design that mimics the rough yet beautiful appearance of juniper foliage. The Lovetand yarn's initial stiffness mirrors the texture of juniper branches, but like the juniper's transformation with time, it softens to a supple and cozy feel after washing, making it a joy to wear.

The Juniper Breeze Scarf pattern is designed to showcase the yarn's unique qualities while also celebrating the healing properties associated with juniper berries. As you work through the stitches, you'll feel a sense of connection to the natural world, as if each knit and purl brings you closer to the essence of the juniper itself.

The pattern incorporates basic knitting techniques, making it suitable for intermediate-level knitters and a rewarding project for experienced ones. With its rhythmic pattern, the Juniper Breeze Scarf is an engaging knit that lets you immerse yourself in the soothing act of creating.

Architexture is a rectangular scarf with pointed ends.  Fully reversible, it is a collection of textures that enhance one another ~ made all the more striking because they are knitted on the bias.  The frequent changes in stitch pattern keep the project engaging from beginning to end.

Although the pattern calls for fingering-weight yarn, sport and dk-weight yarns would work beautifully too.  So choose a lovely solid or semi-solid yarn that will show off the variety of textures, and enjoy yourself as this elegant scarf takes shape in your hands.

I am certainly not the first person to think of knitting a scarf in Linen Stitch, but I have had several questions about how exactly I made this so I have decided to write out a pattern.

The scarf is knit in Linen Stitch lengthwise (each row travels the entire length of the scarf, rather than back and forth along the width).  I used Rowan Tapestry in color 170.

This scarf is named for the early male counterpart to the Roman goddess Ceres (goddess of grain and agriculture), who never made it into the regular Roman pantheon.  The way the colors of the yarn wove together in Linen Stitch reminded me of wheat somehow, and because it's a knit appropriate for men, I dug up the name of this obsolete god.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about the pattern!

Two items of note specified:
1.  Cast on is done with the **Long Tail** method.
2.  To bind off in linen stitch (on the RS), bind off as usual, and knit/slip stitches according to the linen stitch pattern.  For example:  K 1, sl 1, pull 1st st (the one you k) over 2nd st (the one you sl), k1, pull 1st st (sl) over 2nd st (k), sl 1, pull 1st st over 2nd, etc.

***Version 2 Uploaded 8/18/09***

A formatting mistake was made in the Linen Stitch pattern description, so instead of asterisks showing the pattern repeat, everything was italicized.  This is now fixed.

I also added that the bind off is done in Linen Stitch.",,2441,3943,4.31,"7.25 x 54""",DK

This scarf is incredibly easy to knit and would be a good project for knitters at any skill level, especially beginners. It's perfect for social knitting. It’s all garter stitch, which means you knit every row. The asymmetrical shaping is a result of an increase at the beginning of the row and a decrease at the end of the row. There is an additional increase at the end of the next row in the pattern. We chose this gorgeous, hand dyed, self-striping cotton yarn for warm weather knitting and wearing.

Novice knitters will learn how to make a simple increase and decrease in this project.
  
The scarf is approximately 54"" x 36"" x 26"". It is knit flat. Gauge is not critical. 5 sts/in after blocking.

Tip: Place a locking stitch marker at the beginning of Row 5 to act as a visual cue indicating the increase edge. 

**Materials**
1 skein of Urth, Uneek Cotton. 100% Mercerized Cotton. 275 yards.
Size 6 knitting needles, in any comfortable length. Yarn needle. 
Note: Any DK weight yarn will work for this project. Substituting fingering weight would result in a longer, more shawl like piece.

154497,Koigu Linen Stitch Scarf,Churchmouse Yarns and Teas,2.58,32.0,4.0,,500.0,"Linen stitch has a way of harmonizing even the most disparate colors. Our friend Mimi Hepler first created this scarf to use up all her precious Koigu leftovers—18 different colorways! So for our scarf we chose three skeins of [Koigu][1] that combined as many different colors as possible.
But it’s equally beautiful in subtle shades. In fact, we haven’t seen a bad combination yet! That’s the magic of linen stitch. Heck, it’s even beautiful on the ‘wrong’ side.

This scarf literally sprang off my needles. She knew that warm weather was around the corner and was just begging to be the delicate new color pop in our wardrobes. Cheryl at Essence of Autumn dyed two of her luscious summer yarns Silky Linen and Silk/Cashmere with her signature color flair while dreaming about spring.

Errata:
Sprang Right Edge Transition Stitch:
**Row 1 written instructions:** P1, not P2 at the start!
(the chart is correct!)

Sprang is not complicated, and it's also not boring, ensuring you stay engaged with your WIP. You’ll start with a middle strip that is worked with bias shaping in the silky linen… once that is done you pick up stitches for the right edge and work a lace panel outwards with the cash/silk. Finally, you’ll pick up stitches along the left edge and work a Shetland Lace Knitted-On border that I’ve had waiting in my design queue.

THE STASH DIVE SCARF WAS CREATED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. First, I needed something to keep my neck warm on cold winter walks. I'm not a shawl person (I tried knitting one once and quickly abandoned the endeavor - plus, I can't figure out how to wear them), so a scarf was the natural choice for my sartorial and knitting preferences. 

The second problem this colorful pile of squish solves involves my ever-growing stash of yarn odds and ends - half cakes and tiny balls of left-overs that have begun to outgrow their homes! Stash-busting projects are some of my favorites because it feels so good to use what I have in the making of something I'll love and wear. 

Finally, this scarf solved the problem of what to do with myself when I simply can't focus on more involved projects. When life feels heavy, and the world seems infinitely dark, a simple scarf - row after row of gently knit stitches - is just the thing my hands crave! Quiet evenings watching a movie, devouring a new show, or reading a book, are made all the sweeter with a comforting stretch of wool growing steadily from my hands. 

I hope you enjoy knitting this scarf as much as I did! This pattern includes tutorials for knitting in your ends as you go, avoiding a jog when changing colors, sewing up your scarf end, and performing kitchener stitch on the other end. If you'd like to skip the tutorials and go straight to the instructions, head to page 8! Happy Knitting!

246639,Bias 'Before &  After' Scarf,Churchmouse Yarns and Teas,1.74,21.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,,"*With or without beads*

We dubbed this scarf ‘before & after’ because it’s so ugly (truly!) before it’s blocked and so beautiful after. Knitted on the bias, this light, airy scarf has the smooth simplicity of stockinette stitch without all the rolling at the edges. The nearly sheer fabric is perfect for warmer days—layer two for coziness. The earlier version of this pattern had a minor error in the optional beaded bind-off note which we corrected.

NEEDLES & NOTIONS

- US 7 (4.5mm) needles, or size to obtain gauge (works nicely on straights).
- One needle several sizes larger for binding off [we used US 11 (8mm)].
- 3-4 yds/3m smooth waste yarn, crochet hook [size G (4mm) or larger] and locking marker, for provisional cast-on.
- Size 10 (1.15mm) steel crochet hook for placing beads.
- 2 packages Mill Hill size 6 beads (you’ll need 118 beads plus a few extras.)
- Darning needle. 
- 3 short blocking wires.

GAUGE
Approx. 21-22 sts = 4""/10cm in Bias Stockinette, before blocking.
Approx. 19-20 sts = 4""/10cm in Bias Stockinette, after blocking.
Note: It’s a good idea to swatch this one, not to get an exact gauge, but to be sure your fabric isn’t too loose and looks nice after blocking.

---------------------------------------

Important ""knitter's note"" from the the pattern’s website:

“The stockinette stitch fabric of this scarf is remarkably stretchy. Don’t be tempted to skip the provisional cast-on step. You will need a very loose bind-off on each end of the scarf to accommodate this stretchiness.

When you begin, don’t be fooled by the ‘purlish’ appearance of that first row you knitted into the provisional chain—your first stockinette row after this should be a KNIT row (those purl bumps will go away after you remove your chain). This will ensure that the tail you reserve for binding off later will be on the correct end.“

Long, squishy, warm, and colorful this scarf is a great way to use up scraps of yarn left over from your myriad other projects. About 6 yards is all you'll need for any one strand of yarn.

The snippet scarf is designed to use many different weights of yarns. Due to this your gauge will vary from one row to the next. For once I'll tell you gauge isn't important.

This is the easiest scarf ever. PDF includes a diagram for tying the overhand knots that trim the edges as well as plenty of hints for mixing and matching your colors.

**Jesus said, ""Lazarus, come forth!""    John 11:32-45**

Lazarus's sisters let Jesus know that his friend was in a bad way and they wanted him to intervene...pronto.  Jesus chose to wait until Lazarus had been in the grave for four days.  Obviously, it did not look good.  His sisters objected when Jesus wanted the tomb opened up.  He would stink.  We have had a couple of years of world wide unusual events and have all been affected by them.  They stink.  God has seen the beginning from the end.  He has already won. It is getting really close to the time for things to change, for our lives to be re-ordered, or come forth, to the way God originally intended them to be.  Life will be better than we ever imagined.  We can trust Him and rest in that.  Hold on.  He is coming. 

Estonian stitch patterns are so incredibly beautiful, in my humble opinion.  In the Winter 2019 edition of *Piecework Magazine*, Nancy Bush had an article about ""A Haapsulu Lace Pelerine to Knit"" where she talks about this garment falling into the category of ""Rebellious Lace"".  She used Estonian stitch patterns in the round, not flat.  This year, we will be creating a scarf based on these gorgeous stitch patterns, but they will be used in a ""rebellious"" version, not completely in the traditional way.

Come join us in [Knitting in the Loft][2] for our year long MKAL.  Clues will be released monthly beginning January 1, 2023, with November and December released together in November.

**Pattern Details:**
*Finished Size:*  15 inches x 70 inches
*Gauge:*  19 stitches x 32 rows = 4 inches (using light fingering yarn w/US Sz 4/3.5 mm Needles)

*Materials:*
870 Yards Light Fingering/Heavy Lace Weight Yarn
(I used just less that one skein of dye diana dye's TussaLin, but then expanded the pattern by approximately 40 yards.  Two  of my testers used more than to 900 yards.)
**2** - US Size 4/3.5 mm Needles  (We will be doing a Kitchener Stitch to complete our scarf.)
142 8/0 Beads (as charted - you are most welcome to play with more)
325 Nupps  (they are not in every clue, but most clues.  If you would like to substitute beads instead, you can, but the nupps are gorgeous!)
Stitch Markers
Tapestry Needle

**Errata**
January, Chart B Note:  It is row **7**, not 5, where we borrow a stitch from the other side of the repeat to make the double decrease.
March, Chart A, end of Row 3:  the random ""q"" does not belong there.  It is a knit stitch.
March, Chart B, Notes:  Row **7** borrows a stitch from the other side of the stitch marker, not Row 5.
May, Chart A, stitch counts:  Row 20 should read **19 stitches** between the flowers.  Row 32 starts with **24 stitches**, and has **19 stitches** between the flowers again.  Row 29 stitch count on the Chart A, should read **67 sts,** not 69.
June, Chart A Key:  SSK should be **SKP** on RS.  Stitch counts in Chart A, Row 8, should read **""6""** on the right side of the Lily instead of ""5"", and the last count in that row should be a **""9""** instead of an ""8"". 
October, Chart B, Row 7, not 5, has the borrowed stitch to make the SK2P stitch.


Thank you so much to my testers!!!  You are absolutely the best.  MinnesotaNancy, craftyone51, olithia, and MissMelba.  I appreciate your experience and input so much.

SIZE: 

Scarf: 6” W x 92” L (15.25 cm x 234 cm)
Shawl: 18” W x 80” L (46 cm x 203 cm)

MATERIALS: 

Expression Fiber Arts [Pearlescent Worsted][6] and [Enduring Worsted][7] yarn

Scarf Version: 2 skeins of Color A) Abyss Enduring Worsted & 2 skeins of Color B) River Rock Pearlescent Worsted

Shawl Version: 3 skeins of Color A) Poised Pansy Pearlescent Worsted & 3 skeins of Color B) Chilled Pearlescent Worsted

Any two yarns close to the same weight will work. High color contrast is best when learning, so the stitch components are easier to see.

If those colors aren’t available, any from [this category][8] will work.

NEEDLES: 

US size 8 (5.00 mm) circular needle or size needed to obtain gauge

SKILL LEVEL:

Intermediate: This pattern is for those who feel comfortable with knitting and have made a few projects, using various skills and techniques. Skills/concepts include learning brioche knitting techniques through the use of slip stitches, yarn overs, and working two stitches together.

Notes From the Designer:

Two-color brioche knitting can create some stunning designs that are next to impossible to create any other way. Using two contrasting colors, the design appears to float above the background. However, unless there is a thorough understanding of the basics, the stitch patterns can be difficult for the knitter to be successful with.

This pattern will guide you through the steps of understanding the elements of two-color brioche. Working with slip stitches, yarn overs, and “pairs” of stitches, you will learn how to make the basic brioche stitches. A bit of patience is also required, as you will need to learn to look at your stitches in a slightly different way. The reward is a beautifully thick and cozy scarf or shawl and a whole new way to combine all of those yarns in your stash!

* Click [here][9] to watch a video on some tips and tricks to help you learn how to work two color brioche.
* The scarf sample shown used approximately 520 yards total: Color A) 261 yards and Color B) 259 yards.
* The shawl sample shown used approximately 1152 yards total: Color A) 576 yards and Color B) 576 yards.
* Color 1 will be the dark color (DC), and Color 2 will be referred to as the light color (LC).
* Most two-color brioche patterns use the LC at the edges and work it first, followed by the DC. In this pattern, the DC is at the edge, so the brioche row is first worked in DC, followed by LC.
* When working two-color brioche, one brioche row requires knitting the same row twice. You will work the row once in Color 1 (DC), and then slide your work back to the end of the needle and work it again in Color 2 (LC). The work is then turned for the next row.
* The light side (LS) and dark side (DS) indicate which color is most pronounced in the design.
* A brioche row consists of a plain selvedge stitch at each end with alternating plain stitches and a brioche stitch. The brioche stitch is a pair made up of one yarn over and one slipped stitch. As you are learning, check this pattern after completing every row.
* While learning how to work brioche, it is highly recommended that you use lifelines. If you need to rip back, it can be very confusing to find your stitches and yarn overs without one!
* All slipped stitches are worked with the needle inserted as if to purl.
* Read through all of the instructions before beginning. You may choose to work the stripes as indicated, change the number of rows in the striping, or eliminate the stripes altogether.
* The stitch terminology that follows was developed by Nancy Marchant.

**Inspired by Taylor Swift**
This design is inspired by the scarf in (Taylor’s Version) Album Collection from her official merchandise. Similarly, we are knitting our scarf in acrylic yarn with tassels in an easy knit and purl pattern that I’m naming the Swift Stitch. However, we are hand-knitting our scarf with love, while her shop offers a machine-knit version.

Whether you’re a Swiftie yourself or know someone who loves her music, this is the perfect knitted gift that is sure to become a cherished fashion piece for years to come. So, let that ex-boyfriend keep your old scarf in his drawer and let’s knit up a new one together!

**Scarf Construction**
The knitted scarf is created from the bottom up on straight needles. This full-sized adult knitted scarf is finished at 12"" wide and 72"" tall. With fringe tassels, the total length is 80"".

***“A little more finished, a little more refined.”***
We fell in love with a handsome muffler in a favorite designer’s shop. On closer inspection we discovered that it was simply K2/P2 ribbing. What, we wondered, made this scarf so special? It was the finishing. The ribbing was pressed flat which gave the fabric a soft, elegant hand. We’ve added a companion watch-cap with a nice 4-part decrease that’s a little more finished, a little more refined.

**This pattern includes a MKAL version as well as a complete version!**

   Speltas is a 25 Day MKAL for Bumblebee Acres Farm's 3rd Annual Advent MKAL! The word Speltas comes from the Latvian word for ancient grain: spelt. This design takes me back to my Latvian roots, where wheat plays a large part in daily life, culture, and folklore. It is also a symbol of wealth and happiness of contentment- good feelings that I want to share with everyone during the holidays.

   Speltas is a stole, or very wide scarf. It is a simple knit that uses 25 mini skeins- each 10 grams/ 40 yards- to create a deliciously squishy and cozy stole. The design of Speltas is very similar to the shape of a head of wheat, fitting together like a puzzle to show off blocks of colors in each individual grain. The pattern is composed of 25 ""grains"" of wheat, each to be knit one day leading up to Christmas Day. This is a mystery knit along, with each of the first 5 days being unique clues, and afterwards repeating the 4th and 5th clue to create an easy to memorize project during the holidays. If you do not have 25 perfectly sized minis, you can make the pattern your own! Use two or more full skeins of yarn to alternate colors artistically, use smaller scraps combined to make up each ""grain,"" or mix up all three options to make Speltas your own!

* You will need approximately 1000 yards of fingering weight yarn. I used Bumblebee Acres Farm’s Coquette Sock Advent Calendar Mini Skeins these are 25 minis (one different for each day) that are approx 40 yards (10 grams) each. 

* You do not need 25 different colors, you can even do this pattern with 3 full skeins! However, as the designer, I suggest switching your color every day, so you are not using the same color in two consecutive days. ALSO You can use your own stash of minis/leftovers! just be sure that you have at least 10 grams (40 yards) of fingering weight yarn for each clue! More details on how to stagger colors are in the pattern!

* The stitches are easy! You need to know how to: SSK, K2TOG, K, and  Pick up and knit along edge!

* There is no seaming required! Yay!

**About the Pattern**
Hygge and Hearth Scarf is the 4th Annual Advent KAL pattern released and hosted by Bumblebee Acres Farm on Ravelry! This year's pattern is not an MKAL, but a super-simple, calming project that's perfect for the unexpected that always accompanies the holidays. 2020 has been a very difficult year for many, myself included, so I removed the stress from this year's KAL and instead created something I knew I would love to knit any and every day- and I hope you do, too! This pattern has the added benefit of allowing your scraps and minis to truly shine, letting you revel in the colors while enjoying a mindless knit. The finished result is a scrappy, cozy, colorful infinity scarf that fits in any wardrobe and will always remind you of happy hours spent knitting through the season.
Hygge and Hearth is an extra wide infinity scarf composed of squishy garter stitch, rows of carefully placed eyelet lace, and a clean icord border. The construction is a twist on my Myriad of Minis Cowl design. The scarf is designed to be knit daily with a fingering weight 25 day Advent Calendar. This means that if your Advent has 80+ yard minis, you have enough leftovers to make scrappy socks, add them into a cozy memories blanket, or make any of our other Advent designs! Feel free to mix in scraps as you want, stripe 3 full skeins instead of minis, or a combo of all three! Let this advent knit ground you in hygge and homey warmth this season. Happy Holidays!

NOTES
[Click here][3] for a photo tutorial explaining the basic principals of Brioche Stitch. Please note that this Brioche Stitch pattern includes 3 selvedge stitches on each edge.

When counting stitches in Brioche Stitch, yarn overs are not included in the stitch count; they are paired with a knit stitch and the pair of knit/yarn over is counted as a single stitch. The stitch pattern will produce a very pronounced rib; count only the purl and knit columns when counting stitches.

Slip all slipped stitches purlwise.

If you adjust this pattern, be sure to cast on an odd number of stitches.

* Gauge: 18 sts, 24 rows = 4in/10cm in stockinette. It should create a somewhat dense fabric
* Other: Blocking surface and pins required. A stitch counter and/or locking stitch markers are recommended to track rows.

With the recommended yarn, my scarves came out to about
76 in (193 cm) long and 9 in (23 cm) wide. With a finer DK weight yarn (Caron Skinny Cakes in particular), the resulting scarf was 60 inches long and 8 inches across. 

I tend to use needles that are 1mm smaller than recommended on the yarn label, but this is optional. You may just end up with a more open fabric. The yarn I used has a label gauge of 14 sts x 19 rows, but with 5mm needles instead of 6mm, the gauge becomes 18 sts x 24 rows. 

**Blocking Notes**

Hi Y'all, it's been brought to my attention that I didn't really explain how blocking works with the bobbles, or how to fix the bump in the edge at the middle of the scarf.

**For the bump:** I got rid of that by gently getting the scarf damp (only a little) to make it easier to work with, then stretching and pinning it out until I was satisfied with the shape. As I mainly used acrylic yarns for mine, I then applied steam. If you're using wool, you can steam or use a wet blocking technique. But yeah, that gets rid of the bump in the middle, and you can make the ends a bit more spiral-y if desired.

**For the bobbles:** If you're steam blocking, shape the bobble into a sucker and apply steam. Wait until it's cooled down just enough to touch, and adjust the shape as needed. Apply steam again. I did my bobbles this way and they've stayed quite well. 
Alternatively, you can use a marble to keep the centers in if you have some around, as well as some kind of support around the edge of the bobble to keep it from flattening too much. This method comes from the project notes of someone who made a scarf, and would also work well for wet blocking, though that would require more marbles and/or supports. 

I hope this helps!


Happy Knitting!

This scarf complements the Nørrebro Hat, and  is just that kind of project, combining simple ribbing with a sand stitch for the perfect, squishy unisex scarf.

This scarf is pretty freeform, so the gauge is just a guideline. You can make it wider, thinner, longer, shorter, or even convert it into an infinity scarf version (if I try that, I'll include those instructions as well!)

Creating all of these artifacts was the responsibility of a massive team of artists, designers, and prop makers all working under the direction of production designer Stuart Craig. Some of these items, like the broomsticks, simply required a new take on a magical classic, while others, like the zany purple Knight Bus from *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, had to be imagined and built from scratch.

This scarf is an ode to all the magical methods the wizarding world uses to get from A to B. Stitched in the round so there is no visible wrong side, this extra-warm scarf is adorned with broomsticks, Knight Bus motifs, and the symbol for platform nine and three-quarters—where student wizards catch the Hogwarts Express. The scarf length is easily adjustable depending on number of pattern repeats. Multicolored fringe is worked on both ends with a crochet hook, fusing the edges of the tube closed.

***Terra Maris*** is an easy-breezy lace shawl, about land and sea, and everything else that lies in between. 

Garter stitch for sand. Various lace for the ever-changing sea. Slip stitch for little shells, corals, and pieces of polished glass that every wave brings to the shore just for a little while and takes it back again. Everything in this shawl is designed to be simple, relaxing, yet entertaining. And it knits up very quickly. 

The shawl is a rectangular shape, worked on the bias from one side to another. Few stitches to cast on, nothing to bind off. Simple lace segments are both written and charted, you can pick and choose which ones you'd like to use.

***July 2014***  If you like this pattern, you may also want to check out my [Candle Flame Shawl][3] ; a beautiful crescent-shaped shawl with a lace edging and i-cord edge.

I used all 360 yards of the Madeline Tosh Pashima and my scarf is 62 inches long.  If you are substituting a different DK weight yarn which runs a little shorter you will end up with a shorter scarf, which is fine.  This pattern is versatile and you can use any weight yarn in any length.  I came up with the pattern, because I like the way the lace looks different but equally intriguing on both sides.  I hope you enjoy my pattern.

Someone recently asked **how to make this shawl wider**. Here is my answer for everyone’s benefit:
The pattern repeat is over 12 stitches of the original CO stitches and each repeat adds about 2 1/2 inches. So for every 2 1/2 inches of added width add 12 stitches to your CO. Let’s say you want your shawl to be approximately 24 inches wide instead of 8 1/2 inches you would add six lace repeats for a total of nine lace repeats and cast on 9 x 12 + 6 stitches = 114 stitches.
Let me know if you have any more questions.
I am happy you choose my design. Enjoy!

PLEASE NOTE...
This pattern is written with a simple variant of 'turn' sometimes called a DOUBLE STITCH. You may use a Wrap & twist, but the counts are different.  
The technique is described in the pattern, if you can do a W&T, the slightly easier ""DS"" should be a welcome change... however, they are not interchangeable as techniques- the STITCH counts shift... thanks!

<original post below!>
Gorgeous pattern with lots of visual movement.
Much more simple than the previous ""Butterfly/ Papillion"", due to the more static nature of the pattern.

* It is still not simple and takes
  focus.
* It is not great for knit nights or
  social knitting... (sadly) ... if you
  like to chat or drink wine...

It is appropriate for most knitting skills levels (you must be good at the knit stitch and willing to learn a couple new techniques). However, we each know our own skills and attentive abilities.  This one requires much attention.  If you are not generally adept at that, even if you have been knitting for a long time, this may not be your best choice of work.

That being said, many beginner knitters have been able to make the more complex ""Butterfly/ Papillion"" - as they were intent on completing it.

Thank you.

The knitted scarf is created from the bottom up on straight needles using a cable needle, too. This cable stitch is not a reversible pattern, so the heart motif is only visible on the right side of your work. However, the wrong side looks pretty, too, with a smooth Stockinette design of its own.

Cable Repeats
This pattern consists of 24 cast-on stitches in 10-row repeats using 6 different cable stitches to create this beautifully detailed design.

Materials Necessary to Knit Hat from Pattern:
• Yarn Super Bulky Weight #6 in any fiber or color of your choice. 300 – 318 yards (490g – 510g). I knitted my scarf with 3 balls of Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick & Quick Yarn in the pink color Blossom.
• Knitting Needles – Single point Size 11 US (8mm) straight needles, 10″ length or longer.
• Cable Needle. I simply used a double-pointed needle.
• Blocking Mats. I used my favorite Extra Thick KnitIQ Blocking Mats.
• Tapestry Needle
• Scissors

7313122,Mill Hollow,Emily Clawson,2.25,28.0,4.0,garter stitch,430.0,"Mill Hollow is named after a popular camping spot along the Mill Hollow reservoir in northeastern Utah. It’s a beautiful place with meandering streams surrounded by rolling mountain tops. This scarf has been designed to embrace a central stream of simple lace surrounded by rolling garter stitch and tidy i-cord edges.

The scarf is knit from point to point with gradual increases and decreases and uses one skein of fingering weight yarn. Grab that precious skein you’ve been saving to make this versatile accessory.

Measurements - 32 in/80 cm long and 11 in/28 cm wide.

These photos show only a fraction of the many ways you can enjoy this charming piece. It's a beautiful yet fun cowl / infinity / eternity scarf!

The entire scarf is knit in the round.  It is composed of several rows of ribbing set perpendicular to alternating rows of knits  and purls.  This gives the garment an appearance of both horizontal and vertical ribs and creates a luscious texture of warmth and ""scrunchability"" while maintaining an element of elegance.

Infinitude is knit as one piece so it will never blow off in the wind and you can easily customize the fit by simply adjusting the number of stitches cast on.  The small size will wrap around the neck twice and hang just above the waist.  The large size will wrap around the neck three times (as shown in the photo) and hang just to the hips.  The size you make depends on your own height, how much yarn you have on hand and how snuggly you want your cowl to be when wrapped about the neck – the possibilities are infinite!

Have you ever admired the intricate ironwork you can find in beautiful old libraries? In the library stacks, the rows of shelving can be quite fanciful and lovely — it was tracery like this that inspired me to design ‘In the Stacks.’ This sport weight scarf features a beginner-friendly diagonal lace with the look of library ironwork.
 
Throughout the design, sections of the lace alternate with sections of bias stockinette and garter stitch, making for an engaging knit. Shaped like a rectangle with pointed ends, the finished piece is easy to wear and eye-catching, rich with interesting diagonals and textures. The two-color version was inspired by Purlificknitter, a splendid knitter who tested this design. It is an easy yet dramatic way to combine two beautiful colors.

###**About the Pattern**

A Purrfect Scare Halloween Scarf is a fun double knit spooky scarf showcasing images of cats along with other Halloween creatures and scenes. It's purrfect for celebrating the spooktacular holiday!

Double knit, the scarf is designed for three colors (a main color and two contrasting colors) and is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on each side. The design is similar in layout to my [Cat Season Scarf](/patterns/library/cat-season-scarf) but with no repeated sections. The Halloween-themed sections alternate contrasting colors while the main color is used throughout. You can also stick with the traditional two-color scarf if you prefer.

The suggested colors are **black**, **white**, and **orange**: black for the main color, white for the first contrast color, and orange for the second contrast color, but feel free to substitute your own spooky color combinations! Solid colors will work best due to the alternating color combinations in the design.

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished size of the scarf is approximately 70 inches (178 cm) in length and 5.5 inches (14 cm) in width. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 460 yards (421 m) of the main color in fingering weight yarn (black suggested).
* Approximately 190 yards (174 m) of the first contrast color in fingering weight yarn (white suggested).
* Approximately 285 yards (261 m) of the second contrast color in fingering weight yarn (orange suggested).
* Needle to weave in ends.

Note: If you prefer to use only two colors for the scarf, you'll need approximately 460 yards (421 m) each of both colors.

What’s an easy scarf to knit that looks nice, isn’t a basic rib or garter stitch, but can be easily knit while reading a good book or watching a good mystery show? The answer, dear knitter, is the Baker Street Scarf! 
Knit in a lovely cashmere yarn that any man (or woman) would want to wear while looking smart around town, the mix of knit and purl on one side and plain knitting on the opposite side give each side of the scarf a cool and unique look. The scarf worn on the BBC version of Sherlock Holmes is in a darker navy or gray color, but since our model is Neil Gaiman, it had to be in black! Make your own version in basic black like Neil’s to be mysterious, or in a bright color if standing out in a crowd suits you better!

A shallow, garter-stitch triangle, this free pattern is a breeze to knit! Long, tapered ends offer tons of styling and tying options, while an eyelet edging adds interest. Three-color stripes shine in this scarf’s clean simplicity. Pick tonal shades for a gentle touch, or pick high-contrast hues for a bit more punch!

We knit the Easy Striped Triangle Scarf in Rowan Softyak DK. An eminently touchable blend of cool cotton, downy yak fiber, and sturdy nylon, Softyak DK has a springy chainette construction. It knits into a gently bouncy fabric with a lovely drape, after a nice rinse. The pretty color palette of calm neutrals, blushing pastels, and moody jewel tones provides plenty of striping fun.

**Embrace the Chill** is a parallelogram scarf, knit flat and worked on the bias. Designed using four shades of Brooklyn Tweed’s LOFT, this visually captivating piece features stunning mosaic bands, I-cord edges, and eye catching accents to highlight your favorite pop of color.

Use high contrasting shades to create bold graphics or choose muted tones for a more subtle effect. Either way, Embrace the Chill is sure to become a favorite statement piece and accessory for the season. Guaranteed to draw attention, the dramatic stitch patterns of Embrace the Chill are surprisingly simple to knit, using just one color per row to create stunning results. The I-cord edges provide a professional finish and the optional duplicate stitching highlights your chosen pop of color perfectly!   

*The pattern includes written and charted instructions. However, the three primary mosaic stitch patterns are charted only.* 

The pattern also includes guidance for choosing colors. 

I would consider Embrace the Chill to be in the medium range for difficulty.

Not lace, but so lace-like! Not cabled, but twisted by ‘spinning’ a cluster of stitches 180°! Delighted with the simple but dramatic results in Kidsilk Haze, we couldn’t wait to use this stitch in a bigger way.

Introducing the perfect twist on our favorite poncho! With alpaca and wool in equal measure, [Isager Alpaca Merino 2][1] gives texture and definition to the beautiful stitch pattern, blocks beautifully, and has the added bonus of softness and drape. What more could we ask for? Two size options (S/M and L/XL) allow you to create just the right fit. We fastened it with eight small shell buttons.

###**About the Pattern**

Cats love to have their own adventures. Catventure Scarf is a depiction of what I imagine a cat might do upon leaving the house for a day. The scarf features eight different scenes of a cat exploring, making up one long adventure.

Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on either side. Use two solid colors for a classic look or a solid with a color-changing yarn for a more interesting combination (gradual or subtle color changes work best).

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished size of the scarf is approximately 68 inches (173 cm) in length and 5.75 inches (14.6 cm) in width. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.


**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles.
* Approximately 430 yards (393 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn.
* Needle to weave in ends.

It uses a simple repeating pattern and is great for learning how to use a chart.  There are no difficult stitches used.  The pattern is fully written and charted.

The BLT can be made to any size with any weight yarn.  You can choose to do a ton of diamonds with just a touch of mesh, a few diamonds with lots of mesh, or any other ration that you find pleasing.  The pattern works well with self-striping yarn, solids, and variegates. 

The red scarf used about 200 yards of sock weight yarn on size 6 needles.  It is measures about 36 inches across the top edge and is the perfect size for me to tuck the ends in under my jacket.

We all have that skein of yarn in our stash, right? The one that you saw at the local Sheep and Wool festival and just had to buy, even though you had no idea what you wanted to use it for. How about that yarn of the month club yarn that just hasn't made it out of your stash. Or the sock yarn that you fell in love with even though you don't knit socks and you know that it will pool like crazy in anything else? I'm guilty of stashing those skeins myself. So what to do with all of those fun color ways? Go grab one out of your stash and make Confetti!

Confetti is a vortex shawl worked up with simple, easy to memorize sections and a bobble bind off. Its simple enough for car knitting, binge watching Netflix or working on while you are chatting with your friends but interesting enough to hold your attention. I designed this one on the fly, making it up as I went along while I was trying to work myself out of a funk that I had gotten into. I needed something to focus on aside from what was going on in my head and complicated stitch patterns just weren't doing it. I knit this for myself and never intended to publish it until I finished that last bobble. I'm not sure why but knitting this brought me so much joy. I decided to try to remember how I did it so that I could put it out there for all of you. Maybe you need a little joy too. Don't worry though, I had a great group of test knitters who sorted out all of my mistakes and even helped me to sort out the places where I couldn't read my own notes.

7326613,Birch & Moss,Tif Neilan,0.0,24.0,4.0,Eyelet Pattern,364.0,"**Pattern Description**
The Birch & Moss scarf is a cozy accessory for those early spring days. Drawing inspiration from the burgeoning growth and natural allure of the season, Birch & Moss combines delicate eyelets with slip-stitch texture. Crafted using DK weight yarn paired with a strand of laceweight Kid Mohair, the soft textures echo the gentle beauty of early springtime.

Birch & Moss is worked flat, divided into two parts. Part 1 uses C1 + CC held together for the Eyelet Pattern rows, while Part 2 is worked in C2 + CC held together for the Slip-Stitch Pattern rows.

The color transition from C1 to C2 aligns with the change in texture pattern. Alternatively, the entire scarf can be worked with the same yarn throughout.
(combine the C1 + C2 yardage amounts)

**Size**
Birch & Moss measures approximately 7"" / 17.5 cm wide x 73.5"" / 184 cm long

*“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.”*  Deuteronomy 31:6

There have been recent world wide events, and some closer to home, that have caused me to be encouraged by this verse.  We are never alone.  This gives me strength to get through.

Thank you so much, Hitomi Shida, for your incrediblely beautiful stitch patterns, and, Gayle Roehm, for all you have done to help us understand how they are made.  It has been so fun to put this scarf pattern together using these beauties as inspiration.  I hope I do them justice. 

For this MKAL, on the first of each month, beginning in January 2021 a new clue will be released.  For pattern support, you may join us in my group, [Knitting in the Loft][2].  We will knit 30 to 60 rows of beautiful, lacy, Japanese texture that flows from one month to the next.  Lots of sampler scarves have clear dividers separating each month's clue.  This scarf is set up to gradually transition to each new stitch pattern.  I would encourage you to trust the chart when the stitches seem like they are not moving in the direction they were before.  I believe that you will be pleasantly surprised.

This is a colored chart pattern.  I find colored charts easier to read. I have tried to take black and white printers into consideration, but you may want to add some color to help keep the stitches easy to identify. 

The pattern is not written out row by row.  The stitch definitions have been written as clearly as possible.  They have been broken down into step-by-step, if needed, and paired with the symbols used in the charts.  My testers and I have worked hard to make this as clear a pattern as possible for your knitting enjoyment.  Remember, ""One Stitch at a Time.""  You can do this!!!

**Materials**						
880 yards/200 grams #1 Fingering Yarn
   Solid, tonal, or a very subtle gradient yarns

Stitch Markers (optional)
Beads (optional – can be substituted for a few baubles)
   Other than the occasional bauble/nupp, there have not been any   
   beads included in this design.  There is LOTS and LOTS of 
   texture!

**Finished Size**  Approximately 8 x 70 - 11 x 94 inches, depending on the knitting tension of each individual knitter

**Gauge**  10 Knit through the back loop/Purl stitches x 6.5 Knit through the back loop rows in a 1” x 1” square.  (This is a scarf...gauge is not important.)

**errata**

*Stitch Definitions:*
**SPKP** (*A*) pink square:  Slip 1 purlwise, K1, PSSO (left, single decrease)   The key may say (left, 2 sts) - the ""2 stitches"" implies that this decrease will use two stitches to become one.  (The definition is correct.)
**Slip Purlwise 3, K3tog** (SSSPK3tog) ( *d* ) green square: the “K2tog” has been corrected to be “K3tog”
**Wrap2 K2*l*P1K2*l*** ( *l l* ● *l l* ) double outline : the “1” for “P1” has been added.

*January Keys:* cursive “l” is K1tbl on RS or P1tbl on WS. The information in Stitch Definitions and Symbols Charts is correct.

*January Second Chart:* FYI - We will loose a stitch with the ‘YO/No stitch/Double decrease’ sequence on the RS rows, but will gain it back on the ‘P1/YO/P1’ sequence on the WS rows.

*April Second Chart:*  Row 48, stitch 35 needs to be a K1.

Thank you so much to my testers, quilterlis, teowyn, Wookie1950, and MinnesotaNancy. You are the best!

*Once you purchase this pattern it is yours. It is not refundable. Shop thoughtfully.*

This is the beginner-friendly Take-Along Shawl of ‘assigned pooling! There's no RS/WS or stitch count, and it's a breeze to knit! 

Be your own designer, decide how many color Splashes you want, and where! 

The traditional definition of Assigned Pooling occurs when a change in stitch and texture is assigned to changes in color within a skein of variegated yarn. 

With this pattern, depending on how many inches your contrast color takes up in the skein, you will have a trail of accent color after you have done your set stitches for each Color Splash, no matter what side you are on. 

This pattern is written with specifications for a final size of 17"" by 68""—but you can always add more skeins!

Charming Ewe has come up with some great kit options here: https://charmingewe.com/products/pooling-by-the-pool

Enjoy!!

Named for the beautiful winter destination in Austria, this squishy, garter, chevron stitch pattern is a delight to knit and is the perfect holiday project. Designed to work with a 25 10g/40yd mini skein advent calendar and 1 full contrast skein, it can also be worked in scraps, gradients, full skeins, and more. The pattern also includes a Wrap option if you wish to use 20g/80yd minis. You can also work half of your 20g minis and use the other half in any of our other advent/mini patterns, or a Cottagecore Throw! I am all about making the most of my yarn!

The pattern is a 1 row repeat - yes, you read that right!- and features nearly invisible increases and decreases, allowing your colors to be the highlight of this pattern. The stripes of your contrast color pulls the whole project together, giving it an elegant and intentional appearance. It is also reversible! The easy-to-memorize design allows you to knit through the holidays with little stress, and will give you a wonderfully cozy scarf/wrap by Christmas!
Happy Knitting, and if you are knitting the Innsbruck Scarf for advent, Happy Holidays! 

**Yarn:**
A total of 1200 (2400) yards of
Fingering/ Sock weight yarn.
Designed to use 25 different mini skeins in 10 grams/40 yards each and 1 full skein of a contrasting color

**Notes on Color**
     This shawl is designed to show off 25 different colored mini skeins, but you can knit it using other options, too!
How to choose colors
* Main Color(MC) : 1000(2000) yds of a main color, be it 25 minis (one color per section), a gradient skein, scraps, a colorway you have on hand. Each MC section uses about 30-40 yds for the scarf version or 60-80 yds for the Wrap version
* Contrast Color (CC): 1 full skein in a tonal or light speckle. You use about 8(16) yds in each CC Section

**Notes on Construction**
* You can knit Innsbruck Scarf in thicker yarn weights for an extra chunk knit!
* Feeling extra fancy? Hold a strand of brushed mohair or brushed alpaca with your yarn to create a decadent, fuzzy project! 
* You may not want to block your scarf, as leaving it unblocked will leave your garter stitch extra plump and cozy!

Tip: When you complete the first section, weigh the bit of scarf you have completed. This will take away some of the guess work and give you an approximation of how much yarn you need to complete the decrease section.

Other Yarn Weights: The same pattern can be easily used for other yarn weights. Work the same as for sock weight yarn... just replace the 45 sts in the increase section with your desired number of stitches. For worsted weight yarn, 33 to 35 stitches works well. For bulky weight yarns,  recommend anywhere from 25 to 29. There should always be an odd number of stitches. ",,318,181,4.58,,Fingering

Ellsworth, inspired by the artwork of its namesake, Ellsworth Kelly, is a minimalist take on the dramatic relationship between land and sea, and structure and fluidity. Well-defined blocks of contrasting color stand in almost unresolvable tension, only to move, ripple, and coalesce in bashful compromise as encouraged by the coastal breeze. As its colors weave through your fingers and envelop your shoulders, Ellsworth invites both tactile and visual meditation on the dynamic nature of texture, shape, and space.

1272287,Good Things,Hannah Bearup,2.67,32.0,4.0,Lace pattern,,"> As of May 2023, Good Things is
> **free forever.** <br> If you'd like to
> support my work financially, [ko-fi
> tips are greatly appreciated][1]! ❤️

>*I've been through hell today<br>
>I've hit rock bottom<br>
> Good things are bound to come my way*

A product of undiagnosed ADHD and a beautiful mini skein set, Good Things was my answer to an especially difficult few months. After having COVID-19, losing a friend, and dealing with fatphobic healthcare providers, I felt that I deserved to experience some seriously aggressive joy.

This rectangular lace shawl was inspired by the song [""Good Things"" by The Interrupters][2]. I know it's cliche to draw creative influence from music, but I appreciate the song's perspective in regards to difficult times. Instead of breaking down, they demand positive change. As someone who often has to jump through hoops to get what she needs, that attitude really resonates with me.

I'm not a knitwear designer, but I wanted to share this pattern with the fiber community in the hopes that someone might cast on, and demand good things from the universe while making it.

### Measurements

**Length:** 64” / 163cm
**Width:** 15” / 38cm

The pattern details yardage and size based on the original sample, but includes info on how to customize the length and width!

### Yarn used

**Coates and Co Spring Florals Mini-Skein Set**
2-ply fingering weight yarn  
12 x 20g skeins, 80 yds/73m each  
80% superwash merino wool, 20% nylon

### Yardage / Meterage

Good Things is designed to be totally versatile. Use whatever fingering weight yarn you have on hand for the ultimate stash-buster, or grab that mini-skein set you’ve been eyeballing for ages! Each color repeat uses about 80 yds/73m (20g), with 12 color repeats total, equaling about 960 yds/786m (240g) of yarn total. 

**12-color version:**
- C1-12: 80 yds/73m (20g)

**3-color version:** 
- C1-3: 320 yds/293m (80g)

**2-color version:**
- C1 and C2: 480 yds/439m (120g)

To calculate yardage for any number of color combos, take the total yardage/meterage and divide that by number of colors you wish to use. That’s how much you’ll need for each color! I recommend a maximum of 12 colors, but don’t let me stop you if you want to get creative with more than 12!

Each additional repeat added to the length uses approximately 80 yards. 

*Note: For my 12-color shawl, I used every last inch of my 80 yds minis. If you’re not a fan of yarn chicken, you may want to make sure you have a hair more than the numbers listed above - just to be safe.* 

### Gauge

**Gauge:** 22 sts & 26 rows = 10cm / 4"" over St st pattern on 4mm needles after blocking.
**Needles:** 4mm / US 6 straight or circular needle
Always use a needle/hook size that will result in the correct gauge after blocking.
**Notions:** 8.5cm / 33∕8"" pom pom maker, tapestry needle 
**Notes:** This type of scarf is known as a keyhole scarf, where one end can be pulled through the other to secure. The scarf is knit flat and then seamed to make a tube, leaving an opening at one end to pull one pom pom through and secure around the child’s neck. Working the scarf flat rather than in the round ensures the fabric lays flat when seamed and finished, especially the colourwork version.

**update march 4 2014**
Another typo was pointed out to me: the tail section in chart 5 
from rown 380-390 should be much longer. They should be an echo of the same writing in chart 2 between rows 130 and 150.  I am not sure why the tails came out like they did when they were charted, but I am actually planning a bit of revision to make the chart easier. i will update the pattern when it is done.

*This has not been test knit by me yet. I am still in the first 12 rows until I figure out how to do doubleknit!*
(I am knitting this right now and hope to be done by fall... I will update as I go.) I am using fingering and US size 5 needles. My gauge gives me 8 inches across the cast on row. I expect it to be roughly 8 feet long.

This pattern takes between 600-800yds of each color, as reported by finished products, and depending on your gauge.
Most people report using US size 3 and fingering weight yarn.

The little icord edge detail gives this basic accessory a more tailored appearance, and it’s fun to make! This relaxing project is comfort knitting at it's best - plus, it makes a great, quick gift too! I knit this scarf in the gorgeous Titan Bulky from AT Haynes House Yarns - check out their beautiful yarn [here][1]!

**Pattern includes links to:**

Foxy sweater scarf is knitted from one end to the other, to create a very long scarf with a sleeve on each end. It can be worn with the fabric crossing at the front or back and is a nice accessory to have with you when you’re not sure if you’ll get cold enough for a sweater. The stitch pattern on the body is very easy and addicting to knit! The ribbed sleeves are worked in the round and the body flat, with the border picked up as the finishing touch and ribbing is worked for a few rounds. Great project for mindless or travel/car knitting!



PATTERN INFORMATION




Sizes: 1 (2) 3 (4)
To fit bust circumference: 32-40 (41-49) 50-58 (59-67) in.
Length: 106 (135) 164.5 (194) in.
Width: 19 (21.4) 23.8 (26.2) in. 
Ribbed sleeve at elbow (stretched): 15 (17) 19 (21) in. ( rib is very stretchy and sleeves are meant to hug - they can stretch some more beyond these measurements)
Gauge: 20 sts x 24 rows / 4in. in charted pattern.
Needles: Main size - long straight or circular needles in size needed to obtain gauge; Ribbing - DPNs or long circular needles for magic loop in 2 sizes smaller than main needle and circular needles in one size smaller than ribbing needles. (I used size US1 for the cast on, US2 for ribbing and US4 as main needle)
Yarn: Fingering weight.
Yarn used in sample: Little Fox Yarn “Vixen” in colors Bougie Blue (C1), Desert Rose (C2), Lemon Squeezy (C3), Silver Sage (C4).
Yardage:
C1 - 368 (468) 568 (668) yds
C2 - 148 (188) 229 (269) yds
C3 - 180 (232) 284 (336) yds
C4 - 360 (458) 556 (654) yds


Picking a size depends on your preference of how much ease and ease of movement you prefer. The sample shown in the pattern is size 1 worn on a 36 in. bust. If you are a physically busy person, I suggest a tighter fit to keep the sweater scarf closer to the body and snug.

###**About the Pattern**###

Cats can be extremely lovable, and the love you share with a furry feline can be the purest love there is. The **Cat Love Scarf** is similar to my [Cat Season Scarf](/patterns/library/cat-season-scarf) in layout, but featuring depictions of love between and with cats.

Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on either side. Use two solid colors for a classic look or a solid with a variegated yarn for a more interesting combination (gradual or subtle color changes work best).

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished size of the scarf is approximately 71 inches (180 cm) in length and 5.75 inches (14.6 cm) in width. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

Note that this design includes two small sections of non-mirrored double knitting (for lettering). The instructions describe how to knit those sections, but you also have the option of using traditional double knitting for them instead.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 450 yards (411 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn.
* Needle to weave in ends.

1099830,Get in Touch,Fifty Four Ten Studio,1.65,19.0,4.0,pattern stitch,1050.0,"Get in Touch scarf and wrap knitting pattern is easy to knit with worsted weight yarn. An 8-row repeat stitch pattern creates a modern triangular design that is reversible! It looks exactly the same on both sides. 

*If there was ever a year that reminded us how much we value the personal connections with our friends and family… it was 2020.  These days, we have so many choices to easily, and often instantly, **get in touch** with friends and family: text message, phone call, email, social media, and video calls.  The repeating triangles in this 8-row repeat stitch design represent the connections we make when we reach out and **get in touch** with those we care about.*  

**DIRECTIONS FOR THREE (3) SIZES:**
Approximate sizes after blocking…

Scarf: 8” wide x 68” long 
Wide Scarf: 11.5” wide x 70.5” long 
Wrap: 21.5” wide x 62” long 

Any of the sizes may be made longer by adding pattern repeats. Each pattern repeat adds about 1.25” to the length of the project. Pattern includes estimates for additional yardage needed to make each size longer.

**WORSTED #4 WEIGHT YARN:**

Scarf: 410 - 420 yards   
Wide Scarf: 610 - 630 yards
Wrap: 1000 - 1050 yards

Select the needle size that gives the best appearance for your yarn. Finished size and amount of yarn needed may vary depending on yarn choice and gauge.

For the scarf shown, I used two skeins of Malabrigo Rios in the ‘Gris’ colorway.

**GAUGE:**

Pattern stitch with US size 7 needles: approximately 19 stitches & 25 rows = 4”

Though exact gauge is not essential, this stitch pattern will look best with fairly tight stitches. A significantly different gauge may require more (or less) yarn.

**NEEDLES:**

I used US size 7 knitting needles. Choose the needle size that gives the best appearance with your yarn and your knitting tension.

Circular knitting needles recommended for making a wrap in order to comfortably accommodate the number of stitches.

Straight knitting needles may be used for making a scarf.

**SKILL LEVEL:** Easy

You will need to know how to cast on stitches, knit and purl confidently, read a row by row knitting pattern, bind off stitches and weave in ends.

Blocking of finished knitting is recommended.

This pattern uses standard U.S. knitting terms.

Written pattern with row by row instructions.

The pattern is designed by a local designer (me), for a local yarn shop (The Little Yarn Shoppe), with hand-dyed yarn from a local dyer (Blooms and Ewe). This oversized scarf is knit on the bias with a mix of colors and textures. It’s a surprisingly simple knit in an easy to wear style and size, perfect for the varied Michigan weather. Everything about it is pure Michigan, so it is fittingly called Pure Local.



**FINISHED MEASUREMENTS:**
Note: Finished measurements may vary depending
on how aggressively you block your wrap.

The pattern is written for the fingering weight, but you can use any thicker yarn, sport, DK, or worsted weight ( you might need a second skein). 

The shawl is a triangular shape, knitted sideways. The instructions are fully written. The exact gauge is not crucial for this project. It will depend on the fiber content of your yarn and how aggressively you block the finished shawl. Pick a needle size that creates a soft, drapey fabric that has some stitch definition. It might be very different from recommended.

30058,Corvus,Alasdair Post-Quinn,4.27,4.5,1.0,,,"This was the very first double-knitting project I designed and started knitting. It was also the first pattern I released, and it has been available for free on Ravelry ever since. I credit that fact partially for its popularity, but I’d like to think that the pattern’s simplicity and classic look is also responsible. Corvus is a very elegant and unisex scarf, perfect for the bird-lover or goth in your life.

I originally designed this scarf for my sister Margaret, who was at the time obsessed with crows, ravens and other unusually intelligent black birds. I charted the crow design itself from a photo I found online. I have knit two of these, one as a gift and one for a commission, and after the last one I decided to let a sample knitter do the one for the book. I added the marching crow’s feet up and down the body of the scarf partially for structural stability, partially for aesthetics, but mostly to relieve the boredom of working 4+ feet of plain double-stockinette with no color changes. 

**What’s New?**

This pattern is popular and pretty much just fine the way it was, but one thing irked me about it. Due to the even number of stitches cast on, the mock-ribbing section at the beginning had two columns of the same color order next to each other at one edge. The new chart has an odd-numbered CO so that visually-jarring issue isn’t present. The corvid itself also has one column removed to compensate for the missing column, and the crows’ feet have been moved one column closer together. This is not something anyone is ever likely to notice. Full disclosure: I didn’t have the sample re-knit just for these minor improvements, so the photo and your piece will be subtly different. Rest assured, if you follow my charts, yours will be the better-looking one.",,274,883,4.67,6' long,Worsted
789687,Alliteration,Theresa Schabes,1.64,28.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,,"A simple, stockinette stitch, sock scrap scarf worked in the round with ribbed cuffs.

This simple-to-knit scarf uses up lots of fingering weight yarn scraps or mini-skeins by working them into a riot of color and pattern.  Solid ribbed bands at the ends tie it together.  Knit your scarf extra-long to wrap twice, or to be able to slip hands inside the open ends for warmth.  

What happens to all those yarn ends?  Push them to the center of the hollow tube, knot, and trim.  Easy peasy.  

Alliteration uses approximately 375 g or sock/fingering weight scraps and/or mini-skeins.  

Pattern Notes

•	This scarf is constructed as a hollow tube with ribbing at each end.
•	There is no need to use a stitch marker while knitting the tube body of the scarf.  
•	A stitch marker should be used on the ribbed ends of the scarf to ensure there are an equal number of rounds.
•	Self-patterning and self-striping yarns are great to use as they add color and pattern without creating more ends.

If using a light fingering weight yarn like Coast, you may want to use a US 3 (3.5 mm) needle. If you opt for the smaller needle, the resulting scarf will be somewhat narrower and shorter

Finished Dimensions: app. 72-78” long and 8-9.5” wide, depending on yarn used

*While seven skeins of fingering-weight yarn is more than enough to complete a scarf, we can't predict the weather, so are not able to guarantee that one skein of a particular color will be enough, depending on how many days a particular color is knit.",7.0,114,36,4.7,One size,Fingering

###**About the Pattern**

The Meowy Christmas Scarf is a cheery double knit holiday scarf featuring images of cats along with other Christmas and winter scenes. It’s a perfect scarf to wear or gift while celebrating the merry (meowy) holiday!

Double knit, the scarf is designed for three colors (a main color and two contrasting colors) and is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on each side. It is similar in layout to [A Purrfect Scare Halloween Scarf](/patterns/library/a-purrfect-scare-halloween-scarf-mkal) and [Cat Season Scarf](/patterns/library/cat-season-scarf). The Christmas-themed sections alternate contrasting colors while the main color is used throughout. You can also stick with the traditional two-color scarf if you prefer.

The suggested colors are white, red, and green: white for the main color, red for the first contrast color, and green for the second contrast color, but feel free to substitute your own merry color combinations! Solid colors will work best due to the alternating color combinations in the design.

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished size of the scarf is approximately 70 inches (178 cm) in length and 5.5 inches (14 cm) in width. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 460 yards (421 m) of the main color in fingering weight yarn (white suggested).
* Approximately 190 yards (174 m) of the first contrast color in fingering weight yarn (red suggested).
* Approximately 285 yards (261 m) of the second contrast color in fingering weight yarn (green suggested).
* Needle to weave in ends.

Note: If you prefer to use only two colors for the scarf, you’ll need approximately 460 yards (421 m) each of both colors.

NEEDLES & NOTIONS:
**Beanie**: US 6 (4mm) 16""/40cm circular and double-point needles, or size to obtain gauge; plus US 4 (3.5mm) 16""/40cm circular needle, or two sizes smaller than gauge needle.
**Scarf**: US 7 (4.5mm) needles, or size to obtain gauge. Pins, blocking wires (optional).
Both: Cable needle. Locking stitch marker. Darning needle to finish.

GAUGE
**Beanie**: Approx. 28 sts = 4""/10cm on gauge needle in beanie cable pattern, slightly stretched.
**Scarf**: Approx. 26 sts = 4""/10cm on gauge needle in scarf cable pattern, after blocking.
__________________________________________________

The cable pattern in the beanie is very elastic and will stretch to fit comfortably around a small to large size adult head.

As stitches stretch, however, they shorten up a little, so for a larger size (22–24"") we’ve added ½""/1cm of length to the ribbing.

For a custom fit, measure your head from brow bone (or wherever you would like the beanie to sit on your forehead) over your head to the base of your skull. Divide this number in half, and subtract 6""/15.25cm (length of all cable rounds, including decrease rounds). The remainder is the length of ribbing you’ll need to knit.

The collection features 8 patterns intended to make good gifts for everyone on your knitworthy list (because life’s too short to knit for anyone who doesn’t love what you make). Patterns from the collection will be sold individually on the 17th of December.

**Llawenydd**
A rather rugged shawl for wearing on daring adventures, or your daily commute. Llawenydd is worked from the ribbed shortest edge and decreased on one side down to the narrowest tip. The two by two ribbing flows into a bold, double cable pattern surrounding diamonds of richly textured moss stitch. The body of the shawl is stockinette based, sparsely dotted with cable crosses that echo the border pattern. The edges continue the initial ribbing and are neatly decreased together at the tip. These cables are perfect for working without a cable needle, which I highly recommend for a more efficient project.

The shawl is a decent size for wearing over the shoulders or tucked around the neck bandana style. Really big projects don’t exactly fit the scope of Knitworthy, but if you have some time and yarn on your hands this would be stunning scaled up

This shawl can be worked in many different weights of yarn by changing needle size. The pattern is worked in a simple lace pattern from tip to top, so that you may use greater or lesser yardage with ease, to produce a smaller or larger shawl of your choice. Pattern includes both written and charted instructions. My sample shawl shown blocked to 56 x 23 inches using 450 yards of sock yarn. **Notes: the larger needle is used for bind-off only. There's a great little video of the bind off on youtube [here][2]. Thank you, [Roxanne][3]! [Here][4] is the link to a document that shows the stitch numbers for each chart row.

972494,#289 Mini Scarf,SweaterBabe,2.67,26.0,4.0,Leaf Lace,70.0,"Accent scarves are perfect little accessories to add a bit of color and soft texture to your everyday outfit. So why not knit some pretty little lace ones that are just as versatile as your silk ones AND allow you to use up those gorgeous leftover bits from your yarn stash?! 

Well, here you have just the design that will let you do that! This mini scarf pattern features a very pretty, all-over leaf lace stitch. The ends are elegantly tapered and the middle section is thinner to eliminate any bulkiness when worn around the neck or tied around your head or purse strap. 

Each mini scarf works up beautifully using small amounts of fingering-weight yarn. By changing the lace repeats worked in the middle section, you can adjust the length based on the intended use and how much yardage you have on hand.

You could even knit the first half in one color, and the second half in another to make mini scarves in school colors! Or perhaps alternate the colors every two rows for a striped effect. Either way, these are fabulous gift knits!

**Shortest length:** ideal if you have less yarn (or time!) available, are mainly using as a ponytail or purse accent. (Grey and Smokey Blue samples)
**Medium:** most versatile, can be used as a ponytail or purse accent, will stretch to fit most as a hair band or small neck scarf. (Turquoise and Pink samples)
**Longest:** great as a neck scarf or as a hair band with longer tails, as it's approx the diagonal length of a standard 22"" / 56 cm square bandana. (Yellow sample)
**For all lengths:** widest part of tapered ends is 3"" / 7.5 cm; narrowest middle section is 2 ¼"" / 5.5 cm.

Yellow, Blue, and Pink samples are in Purl Soho Linen Quill. Purple multi-toned sample is in madelinetosh Tosh Merino Light. Grey one is in Berocco Folio. Easily substitute a fingering-weight yarn from your stash!

**Errata: The yardage requirements for the scarf have been updated. Scarf requires 401 yds (367 m).**

SKILL LEVEL:

Adventurous Beginner to Intermediate for the scarf. Experience working in the round recommended for the cowl. In addition to having experience working in the round, at least one brioche project should be completed before making the hat.
 
Notes From the Designer:

Brioche knitting creates a wonderfully thick and stretchy fabric. It is ideal for cozy accessories or a bulky pullover. This pattern introduces you to the methods used to create brioche fabric. Keeping the designs in one color will help you to focus on learning the technique before jumping into the slightly more complicated two-color version.

If this is your first brioche project, begin with the scarf. An option for inserting blocks of double brioche is provided. Once you have mastered the stitches and are comfortable with working in the round, give the cowl a try. Although the hat is a little more advanced, with your new brioche skills, this will be a great addition to your set!

* Click [here][5] to view a tutorial on
  some tips and tricks to help you learn
  how to successfully knit Brioche.
* When counting rows, realize that each knit stitch represents two rows. This is because it is worked in one row and slipped in the next. When checking gauge, you should count 19 knit stitches in 4”, which is actually 38 rows.
* While learning how to work brioche, it is highly recommended that you use lifelines. If you need to rip back, it can be very confusing to find your stitches and yarn overs without one!
* On RS rows, slip the first stitch knitwise, wyib. On WS rows, slip the first stitch purlwise, wyif. All other slipped stitches are worked with the needle inserted as if to purl.
* Knitting brioche requires making a yarn over and slipping a stitch. With practice, you will be able to do this in one fluid movement. This is referred to as “sl1yo.”

“A cozy rectangle to knit in two yarn weights (fingering or worsted) and four sizes (scarf/wrap/small throw/large throw). Twining lines in a rich brocade motif add an organic element that relieves the pattern’s formal structure and translates beautifully in both jewel tones and pale shades from nature. Ribbed hems provide a classic, neat finish to the edges.”− Anne Hanson

480607,Feather Flame,Xandy Peters,3.33,24.0,4.0,pattern,450.0,"Feather Flame is a chevron patterned scarf knit on the bias.  It has a scalloped edge and a slight curve that makes it easy to wear. The stitch pattern can be scaled to fit any gauge and yarn weight. Self  striping sock yarn gives definition to the waves of the flame stitch pattern. 

Instructions are given in both chart and written form. Difficulty is intermediate, you need to know about increasing and decreasing using a few techniques but all are explained in the pattern. 

Yarn: 1 skein Lion Brand, Sock-Ease Prints, 438 yards (401 meters) shown in Red Hot, or any fingering or sock weight yarn.

Needles: Size 6 (4mm) straight needles.

Gauge: 24 stitches and 32 rows in a 4 x 4” (10 x 10cm) square in pattern stitch.

Other Materials: Row counter, sewing needle, stitch holder.

Finished size: Approx 60 x 8” (152 x 20 cm)

You could definitely use any weight yarn with this pattern and change the number of repeats to get the width you desire, striping sock yarn just happens to be a great way to show off the flame stitch pattern without using multiple colors to create stripes. That said, the pattern still looks nice in solids. ",7.0,96,315,4.64,"60 x 8"" (152 x 20 cm)",Fingering

Worked in 1x1 rib the scarf is reversible, and looks great on anyone. The Melded Scarf is also a great showcase for variegated and gradient yarns too.* 

I originally designed this pattern for Foster Care to Success’s Red Scarf Project which collects red scarves to send college-bound foster youth for Valentine’s Day. If you enjoy the pattern, please consider making a scarf for the Red Scarf Project or making a donation to the [Foster Care to Success][1] program. 

The Red Scarf Project requests scarfs that are 5-8” wide and 60” long, which is the first size listed. If you want to use every last bit of yarn, work the longer 74” scarf. Of course, you make a scarf as long as you want too.

ll  **Notes and Tips** ll  

The Public Side of the Scarf is the Purl side. However -
for ease of use, the pattern is written and worked from the Knit side.

All ICDD will “Stack” = the center stitch of the ICDD remains situated ~ stacks ~ along the same column.

On ^ Rows, ICDDs (RS & WS) directly preceding or following the center 2 M's will require removal and replacement of M's

There are some unusual st constructions and symbols. 
See the legends, linked videos, and photos on Final Page.

To maximize dimensional effect snug down your decreases.

These scale segments are not only dimensional but overlap a bit and flex like armor plates.


The directional YO closures and the inverse cdd will seem tedious and fiddly at first, like most new techniques. Remember learning cables? But you will get used to them.

You do need to pay attention to your knitting, but it has a logical progression.

It’s knit flat with super bulky yarn, so you can really see your stitches. And it’s quick! This rib pattern has no purl stitches, so you’re learning brioche with half the work. 

Gauge is not critical.

The Hello Brioche Scarf is a design in my book [Brioche Knit Love, 21 Skill Building Projects from Simple to Sublime][1], publication date October 19, 2021. 

The book also includes a [Hello Brioche Hat][2] and [Hello Brioche Mitts][3], so you can explore one color brioche in the round, and combined round and flat.

In this lightweight yet cozy scarf, cabled lines combine with wide ribbing to create a repeating pattern that evokes the bare branches of those trees, ready to start blooming. But if you shift your vision a little bit, you may see the negative space as the shapes of new leaves on those branches as the season starts to pick up the pace. This is a great accessory for those days when there’s still a bit of a chill in the spring air.*

When Karen brought this scarf to our design team, we all agreed the little beads looked like raindrops, reminding us of the A.A. Milne poem, *Waiting at the Window*, that describes watching raindrops race down a windowpane. Once the scarf is on, the beads add a comforting bit of weight to the wonderfully soft drape of this lace-weight scarf.

We offer this pattern in a second size that has the same wingspan; a slightly longer back depth adds more fullness. Once blocked, each scarf is just the right size to wear multiple ways, with long ties to knot, drape, or to pin. Both sizes have 120 sparkling raindrops!

*Note: Both lace-weight and fingering-weight yarns are knit to the same gauge.*

NEEDLES & NOTIONS
US 4 (3.5mm) needles, or size to obtain gauge.
Approx. 130 size 6 glass beads (this allows for a few extras).

1 locking stitch marker. Darning needle to finish.

GAUGE

Approx. 28 sts = 4""/10cm in texture pattern, after blocking.
*Note: As you block texture ridges open, your stitch gauge will draw in.*

1185419,Follow the Spiders Scarf,Tanis Gray,3.4,14.0,4.0,Cable Pattern on Larger Needles worked flat,,"Instructed to “follow the spiders” by Hagrid in *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, Harry and Ron venture into the Forbidden Forest after dark to try and find the creature attacking Muggle-borns at Hogwarts. Instead, much to Ron’s dismay, they find Aragog, Hagrid’s former pet Acromantula, and his offspring. While many of the spiders featured in the scene were created with CGI, Aragog himself was made by the creature shop using an Aquatronic system of cables pumping water rather than oil-pumping hydraulics. His eighteen-foot back legs were operated by puppeteers, while his front legs were mechanical. Voiced by actor Julian Glover, he is one of the most memorable—and terrifying—creatures in the Harry Potter films.

Worked flat back and forth in rows, spiders creep their way up the scarf in a line with two-stitch cable twists on a background of reverse stockinette. Wrapped stitches form the abdomen, and stitches knit through the back loop make the many legs pop. The length is easy to adjust by adding or removing spider repeats.

Its asymmetrical shape and the built-in buttonholes guarantee that it stays in place and looks pretty whenever it is worn.

The pattern is written; it includes a schematic, stitch count-tables, and detailed notes.

The sample is knitted in color PAW PAW, one of our 100% cotton yarns. Our cotton/bamboo and cotton/silk blends will work equally well.

Sample color PAW PAW has three colors: blue, orange, and yellow. We started with the blue.

==================================
--------------------

**Papel Picado** scarf is inspired by Mexican folk art made by cutting elaborate designs into sheets of tissue paper.  Papel Picado translates as “perforated paper,” which creates tissue paper banners with cutout designs to decorate altars, homes, streets, and buildings. 

**Papel Picado**  is a rectangular shape scarf/wrap, knitted sideways on a bias. Only one color is worked at the time. The pattern can be worked from the written instructions or the chart. Read all the notes before you begin.

You can adjust the size and the look of the scarf by casting on more or fewer stitches and using more or fewer colors. Instead of mini skeins, you can use any fingering weight leftovers or gradient yarn.

For me, *quality time* includes time spent with my family, an afternoon enjoying a favorite hobby (knitting!), an evening by the fire reading a good book or a morning walk with a good friend.   Any day that has a bit of quality time worked into it is a good day!

**DIRECTIONS FOR TWO SCARF SIZES + FIVE BLANKET SIZES:** 
Approximate sizes after blocking…

Scarf: 8.75” wide x 63” long 
Wide Scarf: 11.25” wide x 65” long 
Baby Blanket: 28” wide x 30.5” long 
Small Blanket: 30” wide x 32.5” long  
Medium Throw: 34” wide x 36.5” long
Large Throw: 38” wide x 42.5” long   
XL Afghan: 42” wide x 46.5” long   

Finished size may vary depending on yarn weight and gauge used.

Any of the sizes may be made longer by adding pattern repeats. Each pattern repeat adds about .5” to the length of the project. Pattern includes estimates for additional yardage needed to make each size blankets longer.

**WORSTED #4 WEIGHT YARN:**

Scarf: 410 - 420 yards
Wide Scarf: 570 - 600 yards
Baby Blanket: 680 - 700 yards
Small Blanket: 750 - 780 yards
Medium Throw: 960 - 1000 yards
Large Throw: 1250 - 1300 yards 
XL Afghan: 1500 - 1600 yards  

Be sure to buy additional yarn if you plan to add length to your project.

**The all-over stitch pattern looks great with hand dyed multi-color yarns or solid color yarns.** 

The pattern may also be used with slightly lighter or heavier weight yarns. Select the needle size that gives the best appearance for your yarn. Finished size and amount of yarn needed may vary depending on yarn choice and gauge….so buy extra yarn just in case!

*If you prefer Super Bulky weight yarn...please see my [Game Time knitting pattern][3].*

**GAUGE:**

Pattern stitch with US size 9 needles: approximately 16 stitches & 24 rows = 4”

Exact gauge is not essential.

I used US size 9 knitting needles…but choose the needle size that gives the best appearance with your yarn and your knitting tension.

Significantly different gauge may require more yarn.

**NEEDLES:**

Blankets knit flat, in one piece, back and forth on circular knitting needles in order to accommodate the large number of stitches.

Straight knitting needles may be used for making a scarf.

**SKILL LEVEL:** Easy

You will need to know how to cast on stitches, knit and purl confidently, read a row by row knitting pattern, bind off stitches and weave in ends.

Blocking of finished knitting is highly recommended.

This pattern uses standard U.S. knitting terms.

Written pattern with row by row instructions.

NOTES: When you pick up stitches at the beginning of the shawl, make sure you only pick up one leg of the stitch. Picking up the whole stitch will result in a small ridge.

I've had a lot of questions about the direction to work ""in pattern"" for the bind off. Since you will be binding off on a wrong side row, working ""in pattern"" refers to the need to knit the edge stitches, purl most of the body stitches and p1, k1, p1 into the triple yarn-overs while you are binding off.

###**About the Pattern**

Spring is a time for flowers, bees, butterflies, and of course, cats. Spring Fling Scarf is a delightful double knit scarf depicting images of a springtime filled with flowers, cats, and spring life. It's the perfect scarf to wear when dreaming of warmer weather!

Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on either side. It is similar is layout to [A Purrfect Scare Halloween Scarf](/patterns/library/a-purrfect-scare-halloween-scarf) or [Meowy Christmas Scarf](/patterns/library/meowy-christmas-scarf), but it is designed for only two colors of yarn. Use two solid colors for a classic look or a solid paired with a variegated yarn for a more interesting color combination (gradual or subtle color combinations work best). You could even change colors for each section if you have yarn scraps you want to use up!

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished size of the scarf is approximately 70 inches (178 cm) in length and 5.5 inches (14 cm) in width. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 460 yards (421 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn.
* Needle to weave in ends.

Deco Lines celebrates the outstanding Art Deco architecture that adorns New York City.  I used to work near Rockefeller Center, and I often admired the dramatic geometric forms ornamenting doorways, lobbies and elevators there.  I couldn't resist weaving some of these shapes into this cozy reversible scarf.  

Deco Lines is shaped like a rectangle with pointed ends, knitted from one point to the other on the bias.  As you knit, you will travel through a variety of reversible textures that complement one another as they keep your project interesting.  So break out your needles and a lovely solid or semi-solid yarn, and dive into Art Deco style!

Fully written instructions are provided, along with an optional chart for one of the stitch patterns.

***“Throw linen stitch for a loop!”***
We delight in the texture and color-blending brilliance of linen stitch. Worked in the round, this beloved stitch becomes just a little easier! For this Linen Stitch Scarf & Loop, we simply work the same two stitches over and over, always working on the right side of the fabric. We can choose to get a little adventurous —using a spot of stockinette stitch as a guideline, or ‘steek’, we cut a longer loop into a fringed scarf! Of course, we can also choose to knit a stylish loop. Our pattern walks through both the scarf and loop, along with instructions for two different edgings and for three-color or two-color versions. Plenty of options to mix things up!

We chose to knit versions of the Linen Stitch Scarf & Loop in two wonderful, hand-dyed fingering-weight yarns—Madelinetosh Tosh Merino Light and Manos Alegría. We love to see how this stitch’s woven texture ‘pixelates’ and blends the stunning colorways!

Residents living in towns such as Beckenham soon learn to wrap themselves up well when the northerly winds arrive. Here are two scarves that might just keep them – and you – warm during the deepest of chills. 

The *Beckenham Scarf* features a strongly graphical design which is perfect for a man's scarf. It is also completely reversible so it doesn't matter which side shows as the breezes start to blow.

The pattern includes stitch charts & full line-by-line instructions for three different widths, and each of these can be worked in either a soft worsted-weight wool or a super-warm chunky yarn.

1106066,Chancellor Palpatine Scarf,Tanis Gray,5.67,18.5,4.0,Cable Pattern on Larger Needles,,"Chancellor Palpatine’s true colors finally emerge in *Revenge of the Sith*, as we see him transform from a regally dressed Senate leader and concerned politician into the sinister and loathsome Darth Sidious. Hiding his true nature as a Sith for many years, Palpatine uses his position on the senate to manipulate events in his favor, ultimately reshaping the Galactic Republic into the evil Empire and turning promising Jedi Anakin Skywalker to the dark side. Cruel, power hungry, and arrogant, the sleek chancellor is the ultimate villain of the *Star Wars* saga.

Worked flat the long way to mimic the silken woven fabric of Chancellor Palpatine’s over tunic, this unisex cabled scarf is a straightforward and easy-to-memorize eight-row pattern repeat. The intertwined texture of the cable combined with the ruby red make this a luscious, opulent knit for anyone seeking to show off their power.

1294028,Stripes Please,Amy Gunderson,1.38,30.0,4.0,stockinette,2000.0,"For years, I have wanted a super colorful stripey giant scarf all for myself. The timing was finally right this year. In between design projects and work, I found myself some spare knitting time and dug in. This scarf is the ultimate stashbuster and mindless knitting project all rolled into one. This scarf is knit in the round as a tube, and you can really keep going forever and ever on it if you want.

I used every color of fingering weight yarn I had sitting around - no exceptions. I’m a firm believer that by adding more and different colors to a ridiculous degree will always result in a beautiful thing. 

When deciding which color to use next, I really only determined if it had contrast with the previous stripe - that’s pretty much it. I also tried to spread out obvious colors like oranges, yellows, etc. Other than that, the relative randomness of the stripes is what makes the project, in my opinion.

Antler Peak is a versatile, textured scarf that’s sure to become a wardrobe staple for spring and summer outfits (and for fall and winter too). Wear this long, narrow scarf wrapped around your neck in any number of ways or simply drape it over your shoulders as a shawlette.

The Antler stitch pattern looks impressive but it's quite easy, fast, and fun to do. There’s even a video tutorial for it. The stitch pattern is both charted and written…yes, every single row of the chart is written out and included at the end of the pattern! 

The construction is interesting as it starts with three stitches and is worked top-down with a couple of easy short row sections that give it its versatile shape.

This shawl looks best in yarns with little color variation although it would look great with a darker or contrasting color for the section with the Antler Stitch pattern. 

The pattern is written for fingering or sport weight yarn but will look great in DK weight too. Size and yarn usage will vary with differences in yarn and gauge.

The beginner-friendly Carousel of Stripes infinity scarf can be as fanciful and colorful as a merry-go-round - or use just a few colors for a sophisticated look. It's the perfect use for advent/countdown mini-skein sets, or for using lots of little leftover bits of fingering/sock yarn. 

The pattern uses ""jogless"" stripes to hide the transition from one color to another (easy!) and gives you the option whether to seam or to graft the ends of this infinity scarf together, whichever method you prefer. 

You will have as much fun wearing Carousel of Stripes as you will knitting it! Wear it draped loosely once around the neck for casual style or wrapped twice for coziness. 

**Construction:** This infinity scarf is worked in the round to form a long tube, which is then either seamed or grafted to create the circle; the pattern provides instructions for both methods.  
The instructions use a ""jogless stripe"" method to minimize the transition between colors that is normally noticeable when working stripes in the round.

**Techniques:** cast on, knit, slip; working in the round. 

**Gauge and needle size:**  22 sts and 28 rounds to 4""/10 cm in stockinette stitch on US 7/4.5 mm needles or size to obtain gauge. 

**Type of needle:** This scarf is worked in the round. The sample was worked on 12""/30 cm circular needles very comfortably. You could also use double-pointed needles or a long circular needle if you prefer the Magic Loop method. 
The instructions include a choice of grafting the ends of the scarf closed or sewing a seam to close the ends. If you plan to graft the ends closed to finish your scarf, you will also need a spare circular or double-pointed needle to hold the beginning stitches until you are ready to graft them.

**Notions:** Tapestry needle to weave in ends; marker for beginning of round.  

**Yarn requirements:** Fingering/sock yarn, approximately 410 yards/375 meters/95 grams of the main color **and** a total of approximately 275 yards/250 meters/65 grams of contrast color(s), divided by the number of contrast colors you plan to use. 

**Yarn selection and usage**: This pattern can be worked with one main color and a single contrast color, or with numerous contrast colors. This pattern is ideal for an advent/countdown mini-skein set paired with a single solid color. This also a great pattern for using up the leftovers from a bunch of other sock yarn/fingering projects.

###**About the Pattern**

Let's be honest. Every season is cat season. However, **Cat Season Scarf** is a warm, double knit scarf that might be best worn during the colder months of the year. Cat Season Scarf is similar to my [Knit Season Scarf](/patterns/library/knit-season-scarf), except featuring our favorite feline friends.

Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on either side. Full instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished size of the scarf is approximately 70 inches (178 cm) in length and 5.25 inches (13.3 cm) in width. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials:**
- Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
- Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
- Approximately 425-450 yards (389-411 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn.
- Needle to weave in ends.

No one does silk like Alchemy, which makes this scarf more of a necessity than an indulgence. Easy sideways construction allows you to take advantage of every precious yard of this silky yarn. And Gina's lustrous colors are mesmerizing. Two skeins of Silk Purse are all you need for the larger size. Our knitter used size 7 needles to get gauge and a good drape with this slinky DK-weight yarn.

This is probably the easiest scarf for a beginner to knit because there’s nothing to memorize.  

Skill Level:  Easy

You'll need to know how to cast on, bind off, knit st (garter) knit through back loop.

For this scarf, I used 1 skein (Bulky) of Yarn Bee First Love ""Road Trip"" color-transitioning from magentas to blush to subtle golds.  

1 skein (143 yards / 141 grams) Yarn Bee First Love should be enough for an adult size scarf.    Buy 2 skeins if you want an extra wide and long scarf. (286 yds / 282 grams)

Gauge: 4 sts per inch, blocked. Gauge is not critical, but you do want your knitting to be a bit loose so the eyelets bloom after blocking.

Scarf can easily be made longer by adding additional repeats. Purchase an additional hank of yarn if you plan to add repeats.

For the scarf, you’ll simply alternate two knits and two purls to create handsome vertical ribs. In the handwarmers you'll knit a ridged garter-stitch cuff, a smooth stockinette-stitch hand, and a bit of springy K2/P2 ribbing at the finger edge to echo the scarf. It's easy! The pattern shows you how.

PHOTO TUTORIALS IN THIS PATTERN: • Changing balls in ribbing. • Mattress-stitch seaming in garter stitch and stockinette stitch.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: the long-tail cast-on method, the knit stitch, the purl stitch, combining knits & purls, adding a new ball, binding off in pattern, and weaving in tails. Need help with any of these techniques? See our [Learn-To-Knit Companion][1] booklet.

**A Note:** If you are substituting yarns, make sure that you go up 1 mm in needle size. Babyboo calls for a U.S. 5 or 6 (3.75 - 4mm) and the pattern uses a U.S. 8 (5 mm) needle.

Also, and I *cannot stress this enough*, you MUST block this for the garter stitch to relax. Blocking this is easy. Just hand wash according to your yarn label, then grab each end and give it a tug. Lay flat to dry, making sure that your points are ""pointy"". This makes a HUGE difference in the length.

348702,Magic Three-Yarn Scarf & Wrap,Churchmouse Yarns and Teas,1.59,,,,,"***""Easy as 1 - 2 - 3!""***

Our favorite lengthwise scarf takes advantage of the fact that, if you start with three yarns and change yarn every row, the next one you need will always be waiting right where you need it—as if by magic! Because you're changing yarns every row, you get a beautifully integrated fabric (not too stripey) with no wrong side. We love putting yarns together, but it's a great stash busting project, too. 

--------------
THE BASIC RECIPE
You can use this basic 'recipe to make a scarf, wrap or throw of any length and width you wish. Our most successful pieces use at least one bulky yarn, and often include our favorite seasonal novelty yarn. You can't go wrong, so have fun!

YARN
For a medium sized scarf (approx. 6"" / 15cm wide x 60"" / 153cm long, you'll need approx. 87 yds / 80m each of three different yarns, plus approx 5 - 15% more for fringe.
We like mixing one textured yarn, one fuzzy yarn and one smooth yarn; or three colors of the same yarn. At least one of your yarns should call for a needle size US 10-15 (6-10mm).
See '[Knitter's Notes][1]' for what we used for our photos.

NEEDLES
Start with a 24-36"" / 60-90cm circular needle in the size recommended for your thickest yarn; you might change size after you evaluate your swatch. You'll also need one needle two sizes larger than gauge needle to bind off; and a crochet hook to match gauge needle size for provisional cast-on and to attach optional fringe. 

---------------------------
We've put together some of our favorite combinations of yarn for the [wrap and throw projects][2] and made them available on our website. Our free ['Recipe' Card][3] allows you to get creative and plot out your own combinations!

Gardens of Giverny Stole is a rectangular version of [Gardens of Giverny shawl][3]. 

***Gardens of Giverny*** stole and the shawl was inspired by paintings of Claude Monet. He fell in love with Giverny while looking out of a train window. He bought a house and land and set out to create the magnificent gardens he wanted to paint. Some of his most famous paintings were of his gardens in Giverny. This stole is like his paintings — balanced brightly colored lace patches surrounded by simple garter frames.

------------

Stole worked from one end to another in garter stitch with short row(no warps) sections of simple lace in-between. Size is completely customizable, it can be a big stole or a narrow scarf.

* Main color (MC): solid or semisolid
  colored yarn - border 
* Contrast color
  (CC): variegated, handpainted, ombre
  yarn - lace

Trillium Lake is a fun scarf with easy lace accents that’s sure to become a wardrobe staple. Wear it wrapped around your neck in any number of ways or simply drape it over your shoulders as a long, narrow shawlette. It’s perfect for many seasons including cool summer evenings… picture it with a summery dress, linen skirt or pants, and cute sandals.

The lacey stitch pattern looks impressive but is quite fast and easy to do. The construction is entertaining as it starts with just three stitches and is worked top-down in garter stitch with a couple of fun short row sections that make it long and narrow. 

The eyelet stitch pattern is easy lace on a stockinette stitch background. The pattern is both charted and written…yes, every single row of the chart is written out and included at the end of the pattern!

This shawl looks best in yarns with little color variation due to the short row wedges in the body - although the wedges could be done in a different yarn color to make them really stand out. The lace border could also be done in a contrasting color. 

The pattern is written for fingering or heavy lace weight yarn but will look great in sport or DK weight too. Check your stash and have fun choosing your yarn and colors. 

Size and yarn usage will vary with differences in yarn and gauge.

I love the look of stocking stitch but not how it curls.  In this pattern the tubular construction prevents curling, and a double-thickness scarf keeps the gap between coat and neck warm.  Worked in one piece from a skein of luxurious yarn, this would be a great last-minute gift.

The simplicity of the stitch pattern makes it great for variegated yarns, and the tube construction provides a double layer of warmth without adding excessive length.  Orwell Bridge is just the thing to fill those coat lapels with texture and color, or add interest to a plain sweater.

*********************************************

Our Striped Chevron Scarf is a wonderfully summery accessory—whether the weather is cloudy or cloudless! Two row stripes zig-zag off your needles in an easy-to-memorize chevron pattern paired with alternating color blocks. They remind us of vintage café awnings, beach umbrellas, and comfy hammocks swinging in the sun (all perfectly acceptable knitting spots).

We’ve knit this piece in a new cotton-blend—[Berroco Modern Cotton DK][3]. Differing from its big sister, [Modern Cotton][2], only in weight, this cool fiber is a warm weather essential. The balance of Pima cotton and Modal rayon means it’s hard-wearing and machine-washable. A palette of sophisticated neutrals and cheerful brights play together perfectly side-by-side in the waving stripes of this sunny scarf.

GAUGE
16.5 sts and 27 rows = 4” in Stockinette St, blocked. Please see “Important Notes” for more information on how to wash and block this yarn to achieve the best results.

NEEDLES
Size US 9 (5.5 mm): long straight or 24” circular. The piece is knit flat, so choose the needle type according to your personal preference. Adjust needle size if necessary to obtain the correct gauge.

NOTIONS
1 stitch marker, tapestry needle, large stitch holder or scrap yarn, blocking materials (blocking mats & pins, or whatever works for you!).

IMPORTANT NOTES
- This piece starts in the center with the lightest color (A), and then progresses outward to the darkest color (D). Please keep this in mind when planning your color arrangement.
- Please block your swatch the same way you intend to block the finished item, and then measure your gauge. This yarn can change substantially depending on if and how it is blocked. This piece requires blocking to finalize the rectangle shape, otherwise you will have a V-shaped wrap.
- This item is loosely knit to accentuate the lovely drape of this unique fiber blend and to provide it room to “bloom” during washing and blocking. Specific washing instructions are in pattern.
- If you are substituting yarns, please use a light worsted weight yarn, despite the fact that the gauge implies something thicker. I also encourage you to use something with a little drape to it. If you are using an 100% wool you won’t get the same lovely drape shown. For blocking purposes, you will have more success if you use natural fibers.

*I live in the suburbs of Kansas City.  The view from our house is definitely not postcard worthy.  But, there are views to enjoy through the seasons:  flowering trees in the spring, the lovely green of the garden in early summer and the explosion of fall color on old trees in October.  My favorite view from my home studio is on the occasional winter day when large snowflakes fall from the sky and make it feel like I am in the middle of a snow globe. **What is your favorite view?  Share in the comments!***  

**DIRECTIONS FOR FOUR (4) SIZES:**
Approximate sizes after blocking…

Narrow Scarf: 7.5” wide x 64” long 
Medium Scarf: 8.75” wide x 68.5” long 
Wide Scarf: 12” wide x 62” long 
Wrap / Shawl: 18.5” wide x 75” long  

Any of the sizes may be made longer by adding pattern repeats. Each pattern repeat adds about 2” to the length of the project. Pattern includes estimates for additional yardage needed to make each size longer.

**WORSTED #4 WEIGHT YARN:**

Narrow Scarf: 400 - 420 yards
Medium Scarf: 520 - 540 yards
Wide Scarf: 610 - 630 yards     
Wrap: 1200 - 1250 yards     

The pattern may also be used with slightly lighter or heavier weight yarns. Select the needle size that gives the best appearance for your yarn. Finished size and amount of yarn needed may vary depending on yarn choice and gauge….so buy extra yarn just in case!

For the wide scarf shown, I used 3 skeins of Malabrigo Rios in the 'Reflecting Pool' colorway.

**GAUGE:**

Pattern stitch with US size 8 needles: approximately 18 stitches & 24 rows = 4”

I used US size 8 knitting needles.  Choose the needle size that gives the best appearance with your yarn and your knitting tension.

Though exact gauge is not essential, this stitch pattern will look best with fairly tight stitches. A significantly different gauge may require more (or less) yarn.

**NEEDLES:**

Circular knitting needles recommended for making a wrap in order to comfortably accommodate the number of stitches.

Straight knitting needles may be used for making a scarf.

**SKILL LEVEL:** Easy

You will need to know how to cast on stitches, knit and purl confidently, read a row by row knitting pattern, bind off stitches and weave in ends.

Blocking of finished knitting is recommended.

This pattern uses standard U.S. knitting terms.

Written pattern with row by row instructions.

Most of the work is relaxing garter stitch with just a few stitches needed for shaping. Oh…. and the light soft feel is like wearing a warm cloud!!

Mohair yarn is always held double throughout this pattern.
Stripes are made using fingering weight yarn alternating with mohair every two rows throughout the scarf. Each mini skein is knit in its entirety before changing to the next mini skein color. The illusion of more frequent color changes is achieved by alternating the two mohair colors in blocks. The color pattern is much more simple than it appears.

###**About the Pattern**

Sheep are the source of the beautiful, luxurious wool that many knitters use to knit their creations.  They can also be darned cute!  The Counting Sheep Scarf has an entire herd of sheep along its length, in two different colors.  Depending on the yarn you use, it can have white and black sheep, blue and yellow sheep, purple and green sheep, or whatever color combination you can imagine!  If you're counting, there are 55 sheep on each side of the scarf.  The scarf also comes in handy for insomnia -- counting the sheep should put you right to sleep!

Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on each side.  Full instructions are included for the double knitting technique.  The finished length is approximately 60 inches (152 cm). The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

*The Game Time knitting pattern is very easy to knit while watching a game on television...or make a blanket or scarf to keep warm at the game!*  

OCTOBER 2021 UPDATE: The pattern has been updated and slight changes have been made to the two smallest blanket sizes.

DIRECTIONS FOR SCARF + SIX BLANKET SIZES: 
Approximate sizes after blocking…

Scarf: 8.5” wide x 64” long 
XS Lap Blanket: 30.5” wide x 38” long 
Small Blanket: 38” wide x 42.5” long  
Medium Throw: 41” wide x 45” long
Large Throw: 44” wide x 49” long   
XL Afghan: 47.5” wide x  54.5” long   
XXL Afghan: 51.5” wide x 57” long    

Any of the sizes may be made longer by adding pattern repeats. Each pattern repeat adds about 1"" - 1.25” to the length. Pattern includes estimates for additional yardage needed to make each size longer.

SUPER BULKY YARN:

Scarf: 205 - 225 yards
XS Lap Blanket: 500 - 530 yards
Small Blanket: 710 - 740 yards
Medium Throw: 800 - 840 yards
Large Throw: 970 - 1020 yards 
XL Afghan: 1200 - 1250 yards  
XXL Afghan: 1350 - 1450 yards 

I used Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick & Quick in 'Mustard' (blanket) and 'Pumpkin' (scarf).  

*If you prefer lighter weight yarn, please see my [Quality Time][3] blanket and scarf knitting pattern.*

Be sure to buy additional yarn if you plan to add length to your project.

GAUGE:

Pattern stitch with US size 15 needles: approximately 8.5 stitches & 13.5 - 14 rows = 4”

Exact gauge is not essential.

I used US size 15 knitting needles.  Choose the needle size that gives the best appearance with your yarn and your knitting tension.

Significantly different gauge may require more yarn.

NEEDLES:

Blankets knit flat, in one piece, back and forth on circular knitting needles in order to accommodate the large number of stitches.

Straight knitting needles may be used for making a scarf. 

SKILL LEVEL: Easy

You will need to know how to cast on stitches, knit and purl confidently, read a row by row knitting pattern, bind off stitches and weave in ends.

Blocking of finished knitting is suggested but not essential.

This pattern uses standard U.S. knitting terms.

Written pattern with row by row instructions.

This might just be the most relaxing, easiest take-a-long pattern you've ever encountered—and you will go to it again and again! 

There is no stitch count to think about, and the measurements are taken with your eyes (or a tape measure, if you feel inclined)! Once you get a rhythm going, you've totally got this, to the point where you can take it places that you can't even take your phone—just be sure to check back in with your pattern when you're ready for the edge and the bind-off.

It works best to show off variegated, speckled and multi-colored yarn, but it works across the board! 

The written pattern has been carefully tested and edited. Gauge is not important for this one (most got 8-10 rows to 1""), but wet blocking is! My final measurement was 20"" at widest depth by 86"" long tip-to-tip. 

Also, it's adaptable! You can also add a third skein of worsted if you wish, or try it out with other yarn weights.

In fact, you can use the same needle size and 2 skeins of DK—check out the project page for DK projects!

*We experience all four seasons in my hometown – Kansas City.  There are wonderful things to look forward to during each season.  In spring, there are blooming daffodils, tulips and flowering trees. Warm summer days are ideal for a picnic in the park. Crisp fall evenings are perfect for an outdoor fire with a cozy hand knit wrap.  The occasional snowy winter day can be beautiful and peaceful.

DIRECTIONS FOR THREE (3) SIZES:
Approximate sizes after blocking…

Scarf: 8” wide x 69” long
Wide Scarf: 11” wide x 73” long
Wrap / Shawl: 16.5” wide x 66.5” long

ARAN #4 WEIGHT YARN:

Scarf: 420 - 435 yards
Wide Scarf: 610 - 630 yards
Wrap / Shawl: 840 - 870 yards

**Pattern may also be used with worsted or light worsted yarn.**  Keep in mind that thinner yarn will result in a narrower finished width & project may require more or less yarn than noted.  The pattern includes details about how to add stitches to adapt the width.

For the scarf shown, I used two skeins of Blue Sky Fibers Extra alpaca and wool yarn in the ‘Shale’ colorway.

GAUGE:

Pattern stitch with US size 8 needles: approximately 17 stitches & 24 rows = 4”

The pattern instructions include directions for testing gauge using the stitch pattern.

Though exact gauge is not essential, this stitch pattern will look best with fairly tight stitches. Select the needle size that gives the best appearance for your yarn. 

A significantly different gauge may require more (or less) yarn.

NEEDLES:

I used US size 8 knitting needles. Choose the needle size that gives the best appearance with your yarn and your knitting tension.

Circular knitting needles suggested for making a wrap in order to comfortably accommodate the number of stitches.

Straight knitting needles may be used for making a scarf.

SKILL LEVEL: Easy

This scarf is easy to knit and would be a good project for knitters of any skill level, especially beginners. It's an asymmetrical triangle and perfect for social knitting because it’s garter stitch, with an occasional easy eyelet pattern. Many yarn choices are available at your LYSs.

This is a versatile pattern. It will work with just about any yarn weight. Select the yarn you would like to knit it with and appropriately sized needles and away you go! The possibilities are truly endless. Give it a try and let your inner artist out to have fun!

It is knit flat and is approximately 65"" x 50"" x 32"" at bind off edge. Gauge is not critical.

231125,And So Are You,Rose Beck,2.7,24.0,4.0,stockinette and wildflower knot pattern,600.0,"*The fourth shawl of the Be Mine collection, a set of floral-inspired shawlettes designed to be both simple and sweet.*

A textured body and trim pleated border give this shawlette a lovely vintage took.  The narrow crescent shape is worked top-down and achieved with rapid increasing at each edge, allowing you to choose your final size as you knit.  This shawl has several unusual stitches and is more challenging than the previous 3 shawls in the collection, but the result is well worth it.  
 
Samples are shown in heavy fingering/sport weight yarn, but any weight yarn may be used (adjust yardage accordingly).  The size is easily adjusted by changing the size of the body (see Notes).

Skill level: Intermediate.  Stitches include kyok in same stitch; p3tog, yo, p3tog in same stitch; k1,p1,k1 in same stitch.

A crescent-shaped shawl, Autumn Mist pairs the shifting hues of gradient mini-skeins with a delicate wisp of mohair-silk. The gradient colors are all worked in garter stitch, creating broad bands of color in the beginning that narrow and elongate with each new shade. The mohair bands, reminiscent of the morning mists of the cool days of autumn, are worked in stockinette. This simple shawl is completed with a picot bind off in the final shade. Autumn Mist is both striking and diaphanous, cozy and delicate, just perfect for the changing seasons.

You can choose to knit the daily high, or low, or the daily 
average.  See the temperature chart for our color 
recommendations.  If you live somewhere that is 
consistently hotter or colder, you might just want to move.  ;) 
New instructions will be released regularly.  Each month we’ll explore a different stitch pattern, recording that month’s weather changes.  All stitches will be simple enough for most knitters.

I’m planning on making this into a daily knitting ritual for myself—a relaxing end of the day project. Don’t worry if you get behind, you should be able to find weather history online.  

* Choose to knit a scarf, wrap, or blanket--depending on your commitment level.
* Pattern instructions will be released regularly, some days will be multiple rows, some days only one.
* Use size 6 needles, or whatever size you need to get gauge.  The size 7 needles listed in the details are ideal for a blanket.
* Chose to do the daily average, daily high, or daily low.
* Use our temperature guide--or create your own.

Overall this is meant to be a fun project, a relaxing knitting ritual.  I suggest you don't get too bogged down in the details and just go with it.  ;)

In The Light can be worked plain or with an attached border that is unraveled for fringe when all the knitting is done. Knitting and unravelling those stitches for fringe have several advantages: no cutting of little bits of yarn, every fringe will end up basically the same length, and you don’t have to figure out fringe placement. 
The only disadvantage is that you have to knit more.

This was my very first pattern ever, and it's designed to be one of a beginner's first patterns, too! Highly adaptable, it can be made using 1/2 a skein, 1 skein, 2 skeins, or even 3—of ANY weight! Just adjust your needle size according to your yarn's label and personal preference. 

A quick and easy knit, the pattern is perfect for a take-along-project and, as written, is ideal for warmer months. 

If you can KFB, Yarn Over, and knit in garter, you can do this!

This eye-catching design will appeal to men and women alike and may be easily resized as desired. Worked in an intermediate stitch pattern that is soothingly repetitive but never boring, this project is an excellent choice for a first attempt at openwork; it is also portable and easily memorized for knitters on the go. 

In either version, this design works up beautifully in a naturally squishy, airy fiber—the perfect thing for a skein or two of specialty farm yarn.

I created this scarf design to knit as a Christmas present for my mother. She saw me knitting a similar scarf for another popular   Sci-Fi universe and she said ""I wish there was a pattern for a Star Trek scarf."" So that night, I started to work on creating this pattern. This pattern has the ships and insignia of several of the most popular of the Star Trek series: TOS Enterprise, TNG Enterprise, Voyager, and the DS9 space station. 

This scarf uses double knitting to achieve a two sided, mirror image scarf. There are a lot of good tutorials out there on Double Knitting if you haven't tried it before. 

Gauge is not important with this scarf and you can use whatever DK yarn you would like. 

Materials Needed:

* 2 Skeins Universal Yarns Bamboo Pop DK in Black
* 2 Skeins Universal Yarns Bamboo Pop DK in Bright Spot
(Any other DK yarn will do in contrasting colors, you will need about 550 yards of each color.)
* 6 packages Mill Hill Glass Beads Size 6 in Ice
(Or ~450 of other beads you would like of similar or slightly bigger size)
* Size 4 Straight or circular needles. 
* 0.6 mm Crochet hook

The scarf pictured did not include the DS9 space station, however it has been added to this pattern.

I hope you enjoy!

Doesn’t it seem like the world is always in a mad rush? Our “to do” lists are long, and our plates are full. We try our best to check off daily tasks and sometimes we get so harried that we forget about others we meet along the way, who are doing the same thing. 
One small thing we can do to make life a little calmer and happier is simply Be Kind to each other. It’s easy. Take a beat. Take a breath and extend kindness wherever we are. Purposefully taking a pause will feel better and the good that it’ll do will be returned over and over. Life is all about choices and how we manage circumstances. Let’s all choose to Be Kind. From the cast on, this project named itself. Every time I worked on it, that’s what I called it. 
I love the gorgeous color blends and soft texture of Noro, Yukata. Did I say soft?! Yes, it’s a silk/wool blend and it’s so soft in your hands, and on your neck and shoulders. The pattern is a meditative repeat of five different stitch patterns – an easy social knitting project. Enjoy!

A Little Knotty is a small necktie in our own Shepherding Pure Cashmere, in partnership with the wonderful women at [Clean Cashmere][1], a decadent yarn making this the perfect gift to yourself (or someone you REALLY love!) This necktie is available in 2 lengths and is easily customizable. Best of all, it features a faux knot that is cleverly engineered and easy to make, just tuck the end through and it keeps it snug against your neck! 

CONSTRUCTION
The necktie is worked  flat from one pointy end to the other. After the first lace tip is established, the stitches are split onto 2 needles, where front and back layers are worked separately in ribbing. The stitches are then recombined on one needle, creating a tube/hole through which the other end of the necktie will be inserted. 

This necktie has two length options, one makes a short tie similar to the scarves made in the 40s and 50s. The longer length is designed to wrap around the neck twice. 

WHY KNITRINO?
Founded by knitting sisters Andrea & Alison, Knitrino is crafted on the sense of family and community central to the fiber arts. Knitrino is a place for people to share their knowledge, connect and feel part of a wider group of makers with at least one thing in common: a passion for knitting. It’s Knitrino’s goal to make it easy for people to return to making, support small farms, reconnect with their roots and feel present in this world we live in.

Knitrino publishes ""friendly"" patterns. Think of it like Google Maps for navigating a knitting pattern: Click a stitch to see how to do it, highlight your current place, track your progress step by step, see charts in your yarn colors, see only your size, and more. Knitrino’s goal is to make knitting more accessible, and to help people grow into the knitters they aspire to be!

Grandma Josie was an accomplished artist and talented seamstress who sold and serviced Pfaff sewing machines.. I was lucky as a small child that she took me along to assist on service calls in clients’ homes.  As we made our rounds, she taught me the ins and outs of sewing.. I am so blessed to have spent so much time with such an amazing lady.

My grandmother passed away as I was about to attend my Junior Prom, wearing a beautiful lace and ruffle ‘Gunny Sack’ design that my Grandma Josie helped me to construct. It was our last project together.  I’ve been flooded buy so many fond memories of her as I knit this pattern.. I’m so grateful for her. 

Little Josie is constructed of simple 2x2 ribbed cable pattern set off by a field of garter stitch and ichord edge.

**DIRECTIONS FOR FOUR (4) SIZES:**
Approximate sizes after blocking…

Narrow Scarf: 7” wide x 67” long
Medium Scarf: 9” wide x 70” long
Wide Scarf: 11” wide x 65.5” long
Wrap / Shawl: 17” wide x 70” long

Any of the sizes may be made longer by adding pattern repeats. Each pattern repeat adds about 1.5” to the length of the project. Pattern includes estimates for additional yardage needed to make each size longer.

The pattern includes details on how to adjust the width.

**WORSTED #4 WEIGHT YARN:**

Narrow Scarf: 400 - 420 yards
Medium Scarf: 520 - 540 yards
Wide Scarf: 610 - 630 yards
Wrap / Shawl: 1000 - 1050 yards

Stitch pattern looks attractive with solid color yarns, as well as gently variegated, hand dyed colorways.   

For the narrow scarf shown, I used 2 skeins of Malabrigo Rios in the ‘Fresco y Seco’ colorway.

The pattern may also be used with slightly lighter or heavier weight yarns. Select the needle size that gives the best appearance for your yarn. Finished size and amount of yarn needed may vary depending on yarn choice and gauge.

**GAUGE:**

Pattern stitch with US size 8 needles: approximately 18 stitches & 27 rows = 4”

I used US size 8 knitting needles. Choose the needle size that gives the best appearance with your yarn and your knitting tension.

Though exact gauge is not essential, this stitch pattern will look best with fairly tight stitches. A significantly different gauge may require more (or less) yarn.

**NEEDLES:**

Project is worked flat, in one piece on straight or circular knitting needles.  


**SKILL LEVEL:** Easy

You will need to know how to cast on stitches, knit and purl confidently, read a row by row knitting pattern, bind off stitches and weave in ends.

Blocking of finished knitting is recommended.

This pattern uses standard U.S. knitting terms.

Written pattern with row by row instructions.

Select a solid colored yarn; novelty yarns, self-striping or any yarn with a lot of texture will not work well with this pattern, you'll want a yarn that will allow the stitches to shine....and select one you will just love to wear around your neck!

This pattern was originally written to teach a knitting class, each week a new section was introduced. The gauge isn't terribly important, if using thinner/thicker yarn just adjust your needle size accordingly. One of the original knitters in the class used some beautiful fingering cashmere so she used a smaller needle and did more repeats to make her scarf wider.

The shallow triangle is worked ‘both ends against the middle’—two identical pieces are knit separately and then grafted together at the center for perfectly mirrored halves. It can be knit to any size using a lace-weight or light fingering-weight yarn, so make a lavish wrap or tiny kerchief. Perfect all year ‘round!

Knit in a cool plant fiber, like the supple [Shibui Reed][1], this versatile scarf will carry you throughout most of the year. And in a true knitter’s yarn like [Isager's Spinni Wool 1][2], your project will have gorgeous structure that will soften and settle after blocking.

> Living in the Pacific Northwest, hats and scarves are a staple part of my wardrobe during the colder months. Some mornings, keeping track of both a hat and a scarf while trying to walk the dogs and get ready for work is just a little too much, and thus Calash was born. Inspired by the shape of 18th century rain bonnets (or calash), this hooded scarf is roomy enough for a cute hairstyle and warm enough to keep the damp and chill from creeping down your coat. The scarf is knit end-to-end, with simple shaping, creating a scarf that tapers at both ends. An easily memorized and fun stitch pattern frames the face and provides structure. The crown is shaped with a few short rows, which can be omitted if you like a pointy hood. The tails of the scarf are long enough to wrap twice around the neck for extra cold days or can be left hanging in a variety of ways.

Tick Tock. The time changed last night. There's a super moon tonight, and it's going to be Friday the 13th this week, so why not uncomplicate your knitting life and spring forward into a simple new pattern? It's the easiest scarf pattern you'll ever knit and it's time. 
This scarf is a good project for knitters at any skill level, especially beginners. 
It's perfect for social knitting. It’s an asymmetrical triangle, knit in garter stitch. Learn this trick to ensure that you can't mess up, even when chatting away or binging on Knitflix!

Any fingering or sock weight yarn will work in this design. 

The first few images are of a scarf knit with one skein of Urth Yarns, Uneek Fingering in color #3003. Thank you to Barbara for knitting this sample.

Kate is pictured wearing the scarf knit with a lovely hand dyed skein from Trippin' with Dixie Fiber Co. 
The scarf is approximately 65"" x 40"" x 30"". It is knit flat. Gauge is 5 sts./inch and not critical. 
***Thank you to Kate for modeling!***

Materials
1 skein of fingering (or sock) weight yarn, at least 400 yards. Sample pictured was knit with Trippin' with Dixie, ""Honey, I love you, but give me Park Avenue"", in colorway, Central Park Sunrise. 437 yards. 70% super wash wool/20% Silk/10% Cashmere

1096536,Rapson,Scott Rohr,2.56,20.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,775.0,"Rapson is a relatively simple knit, and it's all about straight lines: blocks of color and columns of garter and stockinette stitch, with five accent colors on a neutral background. The scarf's generous width makes it easy to bundle up, and Lore's DK-weight 100% Kent lambswool keeps you warm without extra bulk (those Brits know how to ward off a chill). 

Rapson is named for Minnesota architect Ralph Rapson, Dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Minnesota for many years. His Modernist, Bauhaus style married art and craft: perfect for a cozy scarf with simple geometry.

Lore by The Fibre Co. is a knitter's dream. 100% Kent lambswool, it's soft, warm, with just a bit of stick, perfect when you're joining two colors in the same row. It blocks like a dream, with plenty of bloom. The other great thing about Lore: it's available in both 100-g hanks and 25-g balls, so you're not wasting yarn.

Kits are available—in several colorways—at The Yarnery (yarnery.com).

If you knit this scarf in an alternate yarn, choose a hearty DK-weight, not too smooth (avoid superwash).

A lot of people have asked about how many stitches to cast on for this scarf.  It really depends upon how wide you want the scarf and the yarn you are using.  I cast on 56 stitches on mine.

211870,Volna,Grumperina,3.3,18.0,4.0,pattern stitch,,"Please note:  I included only one version of the *Volna* scarf pattern in the details listed here, but many variations are possible.  Three different ones are featured in the pattern!  Please see [here][1] for details of the other versions, including yarn requirements, needles, finished size, etc.

------------------

Short rows create a sense of movement in the fabric of the *Volna* scarf, which means “wave” in Russian.  Simple eyelets and a serrated border enhance the effect, allowing the eye to follow the progression of knitting, from row to row, wave to colorful wave.  The pattern works up quickly:  it is garter stitch-based (so, the scarf is reversible and there’s no purling!), easy to memorize, and very addictive!

The pattern is well-suited for yarns with long stretches of color, such as many yarns by Noro, Crystal Palace, Plymouth, Regia, Opal, and Schoppel Wolle.  Using a solid or semi-solid yarn would create a beautiful version as well.  There are instructions for three widths – narrow, medium, and wide – and each width can be knit using a variety of yarn weights, from laceweight to bulky.  You can envision and create an endless number of possibilities, from a wispy spring scarf to a cozy winter shawl!  

For example, combine only one skein of Noro Kirameki (laceweight) and the medium version of the pattern to create a lovely lace scarf that’s about 9.5” wide and 78” long.  Or use two skeins of Noro Taiyo (aran weight) and the narrow version for a cozy winter scarf, 7.5” wide and 76” long.  If you’re looking for a show stopper, use two skeins of Noro Sekku (laceweight) and the wide version for a large stole, about 17” wide and 72” long.

TECHNIQUES used in this design:  basic lace knitting, increases and decreases, short rows, reading charts.

Knit from end to end in a wide braided Brioche stitch that “syncopates” or reverses the dominant stitch color ever several repeats, this scarf can be successfully knit in any weight yarn from fingering through worsted.  I chose to knit mine in fingering weight for the enhanced drapability, and used almost the full 2 skeins (425 yards per skin) of the off white and charcoal Merino Wool yarn I knit this in.  My scarf ended up being 7 feet long and about 8.5 inches wide.  Flip the scarf over and the dominant colors are reversed on each side.

Laphroaig is my reply to his wish for a perfect, simple man-scarf.  He wanted a classic wrap that he could wear a little dressier for work or casually on the weekend.  So this gorgeous tweed, simple texture, and ribbing will work equally well with a dress shirt or a flannel. 

And although I've included instructions so you can modified the pattern easily for ANY length or width, he wanted this exact size. Long enough to wear it straight down, wrapped around his neck, or folded flat inside a jacket -- and wide enough to be cozy in each of those variations.

The 2022 Year of Delicate Lace Scarf will be a beautiful, beaded (optional) scarf. We will challenge ourselves with knitting this scarf in lace patterns that use no 'plain purl rows' on the wrong side. There will be pattern rows on each side except for the transitions between patterns.

Beginning in January 2022, you will receive a section of the pattern to add to your scarf on the 1st of every month. The final section will be revealed in November. This will give plenty of time to complete your scarf for wearing or gifting during the Winter holidays.

Upon purchase, you will receive the introduction page with all the information about supplies needed. This gives you the opportunity to be ready to cast on January 1, 2022. Please join us for this lace challenge year!

﻿**A note on color and color changes:** 
Our colorway was created from surveying many photos, and Doctor Who episodes, and trying to work through our dyes to create a pleasing representation as we saw it. There are, undoubtedly, variations from our colorway to the real scarf that we have not seen in-person, and what you see on your monitors. Know that we attempted to match colors, but acknowledge our limitations, variations in vision, and even our own preferences. We have created a “looks like” but not an “is” kit. Perhaps one day we can travel to England to examine the scarf and dye yarn to exactly match! 

We used math to approximate how much yarn per color was needed to match the original scarf. While we got pretty close, due to many variables, color changes are not likely to occur at the ends of rows. Cutting and weaving in ends is one option if you would like to make the changes happen at the end of the rows. But we suggest that you keep in line with history. So... take your box of yarn and “make a scarf.” Enjoy!",6.0,11,10,0.0,approx. 12 feet long with tassels,Worsted

~mightbekatrina (AKA Dr. Erma)

A quick correction: pg 202, 2nd paragraph, I say ""Work back (right to left) across Row 2."" That should most definitely be *left to right*, as you usually do for an even row on a chart.

knitCompanion users: if Chart 5 is giving you trouble, [give this reformatted version a try][2].

414793,Ellen Scarf,Nancy Ricci,1.77,26.0,4.0,st st,618.0,"The Ellen Scarf is a st st based scarf, worked on the bias with garter stitch edges.
The first and the last part of this scarf are striped and the middle part is color blocked. Use two contrasting colors.

The striped part is established by alternating the colors every 2 rows without cutting the yarn. This means you are carrying up the two different color yarns every two rows on the right side edge.

The yarn used, Sylph by Jade Sapphire, is a delicious blend of linen and cashmere. It is a pleasure to work with and the result is extremely soft an flowy.
The colors I used are Hush and Monsoon.

As you’ve probably noticed from Parallax v0.5 and 1.0, in a standard scarf you get the opportunity to show off the expansion or compression areas of the Parallax patterns. Parallax v1.0 centers on the expansion points -- making the repeats look like pillows or fisheyes. Parallax v0.5 centers on the compression points -- making the repeats look like stars. I wanted to show both of these in the same scarf, but I didn’t want to make it overly wide. So I made it on the bias, moving every other row over by one pair through judicious use of increase and corresponding decrease. The pattern for this is complicated, but as you get into it, you’ll begin to feel the rhythm and perhaps you might not even need the chart after a while. The forest green color I chose is actually a Kauni Solid; I wanted to highlight the fact that Kauni has an amazing range of solid colors as well as their Effektgarn line. Most shops don’t carry it but you should be able to get them to order it and maybe that will change.

Worked in two halves and grafted in the center this single sided lace scarf will teach you the intricacies of working shaped lace, integrated i-cord edging and reading a chart… it’s your gateway drug to unexpected but simple lace techniques!  Forza is worked in two halves as the Forza stitch must be worked from the bottom up to achieve mirrored shaping at the bottom edge.

I know I’ve told you that designing the simple things is hard for me, but it’s never been more true than with this design. I forced myself to only use three lace stitches; the yarnover, a left leaning decrease (ssk) and a right leaning decrease (k2tog).  As I was swatching I kept trying to throw in a little something different but kept to my rules!  The result is a scarf that will teach you that you CAN knit lace, and that it’s FUN and EASY!  Hope you agree : )!

The Forza Stitch is both charted and written out; you get to decide which you prefer to work.

Noro Kureyon knit in a long, thin strip gives a nice color gradient. This scarf combines that long strip with solid borders of slipped garter ribbing for a handsome scarf. 

The length of the scarf is determined by the length of the strip of Noro and can be as long or short as desired. Yardage for the Cascade is based on knitting two full skeins of Kureyon at the given gauge. The width of the solid borders can be altered as well. 

**Skills required:**
• Long-tail cast-on
• Picking up stitches in a slipped stitch edge
• Slipping stitches

7303010,Confectioner,Tasha Moss,0.0,32.0,4.0,pattern stitch,80.0,"Confectioner is a sweet little scarflet pattern! It’s a great project for leftover yarn and mini skeins.

It’s a quick beginner-friendly knit, with a bias shape that’s enhanced by uneven stripes reminiscent of candy canes and ribbon candy—the inspiration for its name! They’re fast and fun and keep you wanting to knit just *one* more stripe.

The ribbed stitch pattern means it resembles stockinette but will never curl, with a perfect transition between colors (no purl bumps showing!) that adds a subtle texture. The slipped edging gives the scarf a polished finish.

Follow the clearly-written pattern like normal, but for even more help, if you’d like to learn how to read your rows and knit the majority of your Confectioner without the pattern, **watch the video guide, that comes with the pattern**!

**Size and Yarn Requirements**

Approx. 4” / 10cm wide and 30” / 75cm long
-Color A:  80 yds / 75m
-Color B:  60 yds / 55m

**Want it longer?** For each additional 2 more stripes of each color (approx. 5” / 13cm more total length), you will need an extra:
-Color A:  8yds / 7m
-Color B:  6 yards / 6m


Samples were knit using small amounts of leftover yarns, with 2 yarns held throughout: fingering weight carried with matching lace weight mohair. Required yardage above is for each strand of both colors.

If using only one strand of each color, use a DK weight for similar gauge and finished size.

However, any weight of yarn or combination of yarns would be lovely. Get creative!

-Yarn 2 (lace weight) - Hobbii Diablo (246yds / 225m per 25g)

**Gauge**

32 sts / 32 rows = 4” / 10cm in * k1, p1 * ribbing (i.e. 1x1 rib), using 3.5mm (US 4) needles, or size needed to obtain gauge.

**Gauge is not critical for this project!** Even between the 2 samples knit, row gauge was a smidge different.

However, smaller needles than normal are recommended for the weight of yarn, for a firmer fabric in the stitch pattern. 

Keep this in mind if changing weight of yarn used.

7323667,Pretty Little Brioche Scarf,Kavitha Raman,2.33,25.0,4.0,Brioche Ribbing,356.0,"
I started Pretty Little Brioche Scarf as a project for someone who had just learned the basic brioche stitches and was looking for a project to try. I wanted to create a project that is not overwhelming, somewhat easy to put down and pick up later without having to refer to the pattern often. 
It quickly became my go-to project to knit during in-between moments throughout the day.

""Pretty Little Brioche Scarf"" is worked sideways from tip to tip in two-color brioche stitch with a slip-stitch selvedge on both edges. I love how this fits into my line of long and shallow scarf/shawl designs that are easy to wrap around the neck/shoulders -- Soar, Esse, Synclines, Vivir, to name a few.
Over time, I have come to appreciate this shape because it is so portable and makes for an easy layer to carry around when the weather changes throughout the day.

**FEATURES**
♡ Written for 3 sizes.
♡ Designed to be beginner-friendly - small amounts of stitches and long repeats allows for a lot of brioche practice. 
♡ The smallest size is especially suitable for a reasonably-quick and charming gift. 
♡ As long as you like the fabric you are making, gauge is not very important in this project. You can add or lessen the number of repeats as desired. 
♡ A separate row tracker pdf is available to download when you purchase the pattern.

It can be made in any yarn and at any gauge but the pattern is written for fingering weight yarns.

The stitch pattern is unusually good for combining two yarns with fine stripes that change every two rows. You just need approximately 400 yards of each yarn. The first image is worked in two close shades of hand-painted merino similar to Koigu, the second is in hand-painted merino and silk mohair and the third is in many small pieces of yarn in many colors. 

It's also beautiful pattern in a single solid luxury yarn like Catherine Lowe's merino 3.

",800.0,"When Melissa of Sweet Fiber sent me an unexpected box FULL of gorgeous yarns, this cashmere DK begged to be knit up first.  The subtle shades of her color and the feel of her cashmere are to die for.  And I’ve always wanted a giant scarf that’s super soft, extra wide, and boldly lacy.  

The distinct geometric lines in this pattern give some texture to the lace and makes following the motif easier than you'd think. Simple ribs edge the main panel and play off the tips of the final diamond shapes.  

It’s big and wide, but not so big that it can’t be tucked into a coat or worn with a blazer as an indoor accessory, and it drapes and falls perfectly around your shoulders.  Modifying for length or width is easy to do and instructions are given in the pattern.  Exact gauge is not terribly important, but will result in a different size scarf.

This perfect shade of spiced pumpkin says FALL to me, and I cannot wait to pair this with an old denim jacket and pick some apples….

Two different yarns in contrasting colors combine to create a simple but intriguing scarf. Each pair of rows is worked alternately with *Shelter* and *Loft* in brioche stitch. Amplify the herringbone effect with a high-contrast pairing — like the sample is knit in *Cast Iron* and *Fossil* — or use closely related hues for a gentle glow. Imagine a festive Crosshatch in *Long Johns* and *Cinnabar* or a moody version blending *Stormcloud* and *Faded Quilt*. Stretch-blocking on wires opens up the fabric to further expose the stitch pattern and give the finished fabric a beautiful drape.

This pattern was published as part of Jared Flood’s first print book, WOOLENS. You can purchase all patterns in this collection as an ebook at [brooklyntweed.com][4].

--------------------------------------------------------

**Construction**

The scarf or wrap is worked from end to end with two weights of yarn used alternately—one strand of worsted weight and one strand of fingering weight.

**Yardage**

Scarf (Wrap)
385 (715) yards of worsted weight wool yarn in Color 1 (C1)
495 (905) yards of fingering weight wool yarn in Color 2 (C2)

**Yarn**

3 (6) skeins of Brooklyn Tweed *Shelter* (100% American Targhee-Columbia wool; 140 yards/50g)
2 (4) skeins of Brooklyn Tweed *Loft* (100% American Targhee-Columbia wool; 275 yards/50g)
Scarf photographed in colors *Old World* (C1) & *Artifact* (C2) and wrap photographed in colors *Cast Iron* (C1) & *Fossil* (C2)

*Crosshatch can also be knit with Arbor and Peerie. We knit our sample with 3 skeins of Arbor, in colorway Mesa, and 2 skeins of Peerie, in colorway Cassis.*

**Gauge**

13 stitches & 40 rows = 4"" in Brioche Stitch with Size A needle(s), after stretch-blocking
*Note that for Brioche Stitch, each elongated stitch in a column of knit stitches represents two rows; when you count these it will appear that 20 rows = 4""*

**Needles**

Size A (for Brioche Fabric)
One 32"" circular needle in size needed to obtain gauge listed
Suggested Size: 4 mm (US 6)

Size B (for Tubular Cast On; optional)
One 32"" circular needle one size smaller than Size A
Suggested Size: 3¾ mm (US 5)

*A circular needle is required in order to slide the piece back and forth while working the stitch pattern.*

*Note: if you have adjusted the needle size to obtain the correct gauge, it may or may not be necessary to make a matching adjustment to the needle size used for Tubular Cast On due to variance in individual work. You may wish to test your chosen cast-on method on your swatch.*

**Finished Dimensions**

Scarf (Wrap)
13¼ (25½)"" [33.5 (65) cm] wide; 76¼"" [193.5 cm] long
Measurements taken from relaxed fabric after stretch-blocking

**DIRECTIONS FOR THREE SIZES:**
*Approximate sizes after blocking…*

Scarf: 8.5” wide x 64” long 
Wide Scarf: 11” wide x 70” long 
Wrap: 17” wide x 60” long 

Finished size may vary depending on yarn weight and gauge used.

Any of the sizes may be made longer by adding pattern repeats. Each pattern repeat adds about 1” to the length of the project. Pattern includes estimates for additional yardage needed to make each size longer.

**ARAN or HEAVY WORSTED #4 WEIGHT YARN:**

Scarf: 420 - 435 yards
Wide Scarf: 630 - 650 yards
Wrap: 840 - 870 yards

The pattern may also be used with slightly lighter weight yarns. Select the needle size that gives the best appearance for your yarn. Finished size and amount of yarn needed may vary depending on yarn choice and gauge….so buy extra yarn just in case!

For the scarf, I used two skeins of Blue Sky Fibers 'Extra' Aran weight yarn in the 'Mist' colorway.

For a blanket design with the same stitch pattern...please see my [These Days Blanket][2] (for worsted) or [Little Moments blanket][3] (for bulky).   

**GAUGE:**

Pattern stitch with US size 8 needles: approximately 17 stitches & 25 rows = 4”

I used US size 8 knitting needles…but choose the needle size that gives the best appearance with your yarn and your knitting tension.

Though exact gauge is not essential, this stitch pattern will look best with fairly tight stitches.  

Significantly different gauge may require more yarn.

**NEEDLES:**

Circular knitting needles recommended for making a wrap or wide scarf in order to comfortably accommodate the number of stitches.

Straight knitting needles may be used for making a scarf.

**SKILL LEVEL:** Easy

You will need to know how to cast on stitches, knit and purl confidently, read a row by row knitting pattern, bind off stitches and weave in ends.

Blocking of finished knitting is recommended.

This pattern uses standard U.S. knitting terms.

Written pattern with row by row instructions.

This elegant wrap is simple to work in two-color linen stitch. 

**Skills required**
Long-tail cast-on
Slipping stitches

**Gauge**
Sample was knit at a gauge of 25 stitches and 37 rows in 4 inches of linen stitch. Gauge is not critical but will affect your finished size and yardage required. Swatching is strongly encouraged to determine which needle size gives the best fabric with your chosen yarn – linen stitch requires a much larger needle size than usual and you may have to experiment a bit to get a nice fabric

**Measurements**
Pattern directions will give a scarf approximately 8.5 inches x 68 inches or a wrap 17.5 inches x 68 inches at the specified gauge and yardage

**Materials**
Approximately 500/1000 yards (scarf/wrap) of sport or dk-weight yarn to knit as shown. Sample wrap was knit in Simply Alpaca by Knitpicks – 2 skeins of Alexis (black) and 2 skeins of Alfie (light grey). This yarn is classified as aran-weight, but is more of a sport or dk weight

*Erratum: All (WS) Rows: [P1, k1] 7 times, p1, SM (continue slipping all markers as you come to them), p34, [**k1,p1**] 7 times, k1.*

Arden is a beaded lace scarf with a deep seed stitch border. I was inspired by the gorgeous hue ""Pine"" in EFA's Oasis Fingering yarn. The rich green color combined with a leafy lace pattern reminded me of the Forest of Arden in Shakespeare's *As You Like It*. The added beads, suggested by EFA's team member, Pam, add a beautiful accent to the lace pattern and bring out the luster of the silk in the yarn.

* [Click here][6] to learn how to
  knit and bead the lace portion of the
  scarf.
* This pattern maintains a 15 stitch
  border of seed stitch throughout the
  working of the interior lace pattern.
  The lace pattern is a block of 12 rows
  that are repeated. There are a total
  of 3 lace pattern repeats per each RS
  row.
* Should you desire a wider scarf or shawl, cast
  on additional sts in multiples of 11
  and work those sts as an extra repeat
  of the lace pattern (sts 13-23 on the
  chart). You will need to add 4
  additional beads per repeat section on
  the chart.
* Gauge is not crucial to this project,
  but will affect yardage, size, and
  number of beads needed. There are 12
  beads needed per 12 row repeat.
* Because hand-dyed yarn can show
  natural variations in color and tone,
  you may wish to [alternate your skeins][7]
  every two rows to ensure an even blend
  of color and tone between skeins.

Silly Goose Yarns was named in honor of dyer Courtney's first dog Tina Ballerina, a princess of a dog brought incredible amounts of joy and love to her life; even in her old age she was still spunky, smiling and happy to be with her humans.

increases to a garter-stitch border. Throughout the pattern, each right side row increases the total stitch count by 1 stitch. When alternating colors every two rows in the Openwork Pattern, do not cut the yarn; carry the yarn not in use up the outside edge.

Snow days from school were few and far between; our district didn’t call off school unless our very lives were in peril (and even then, it sure seemed like they took their time thinking about it). My Snow Day Shawl is an homage to those blessed days when the weather gave us plump flakes of snow, freezing rain, hail, flurries and maybe even sheets of ice (or any combination thereof) so we could stay home from school. You’ll see these weather patterns mimicked throughout the stitches on this nostalgic shawl. It’s incredibly cozy and warm, and just the right size to wrap once and pin closed—bulky, but in a manageable size. 

Snow Day is a triangle shawl worked from the bottom center point to the top with a series of increases at the edges. Snow Day grows from the bottom point to the top bind-off edge.

###**About the Pattern**

Music and knitting are both forms of artistic expression, and this Musical Scarf combines both in a warm, comfy scarf.  Completely reversible, the scarf features musical notations on both sides, with the colors on opposite sides inverted.  A beautiful gradient combined with a contrasting solid color shows off the design nicely!

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The pattern includes charts for both the traditional double knitting (which reverses the pattern on the back) and the non-mirrored version, which orients the musical notations in the correct direction on both sides. The finished width is approximately 5 inches (12.7 cm) and the finished length is approximately 68 inches (173 cm). The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 400-425 yards (366-389 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn.
* Needle to weave in ends.

**Errata**
In the key for the charts, the white symbol with the small plus should be a white symbol with a diamond to match the symbol in the charts more closely.

Blossoms and bees share a precious relationship. As flowers offer bees nectar and pollen to feed their colonies, bees help plants reproduce by ferrying pollen from flower to flower.

Bee Loved celebrates this symbiosis with slip-stitch honeycomb cells and tiny dots of pollen (that won’t make you sneeze). This sport or fingering weight scarf is knitted from one pointed end to the other and is a great way to showcase a gorgeous skein of variegated yarn.  When not in use, this color can be carried invisibly in the i-cord edges, so there are very few ends to weave in.

When you’re done, you or your ‘honey’ can wrap up and feel the love!

Arda, the world in which the Silmarillion and Lord of the Rings takes place, seemed the perfect name for this shawl pattern, which was knit using Lord of the Rings inspired yarn and provides a world of creative possibilities. Bias knitting provides the perfect blend of simplicity and engaging knitting, while an easily memorizable two-row pattern repeat is simple enough for mindless knitting and engaging enough to keep you knitting. The eyelet moss stitch also creates a lovely open texture without being too hole-y while also being the perfect stitch pattern for blending subtle fades. With instructions for a large and small shawl as well as a scarf version, Arda is sure to become a staple of your wardrobe, whichever size you choose to knit.

Through the nearly twenty years that I have been knitting, I have made many iterations of this scarf. Each version has been tweaked and refined, ultimately landing on what I think of as the perfect dimensions for a scarf. Which is to say, not so narrow as to feel/look scrimpy, but not so long or wide as to waste knitterly focus or yardage. 

When picking your colors, please choose a wide array of hues that, well, make you happy! Any fingering weight yarn can be used for this project: single ply, sock, variegated, speckled, solid, muted, neon, EVERYTHING. When they’re in a jumble, you might think they don’t go together. But you’ll find that once you start knitting the stripes, a good part of the fun will be planning your next color – or set of colors – so that your scarf starts to tell a beautiful color story!

When your softer side want to slip into something a little silkier, this is the pattern (and yarn!) you'll want to go to. Yarned and Dangerous is a quick, soothing, and fun knit that works in any weather, and is versatile across occasions!

###**About the Pattern**

Knit this elegant Celtic cat scarf for the cat lover in your life!

Surrounded by beautiful Celtic knots, the paired cats in the Celtic Cat Scarf intertwine their tails to join in the expanding knotwork. Celtic knot designs have long been featured in knitted garments and accessories, and this scarf is perfect for a love of cats with an artistic flair!

Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on either side. Use two solid colors for a classic look or a solid paired with a variegated yarn for a more interesting color combination (gradual or subtle color changes work best).

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished size of the scarf is approximately 70 inches (178 cm) in length and 5.25 inches (13.3 cm) in width. The length of the scarf can be increased or decreased by approximately 9.5 inches (24 cm). The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 430 yards (393 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn.

This pattern is also part of my Systema Naturae Collection and eBook. All of the designs from this collection are inspired by the beautiful organic shapes of seashells. Turritella comes from Latin *turrittus* meaning ""turreted"" or ""towered"" and the diminutive suffix ~ella. A genus of medium-sized sea snails with tightly coiled shells, whose overall shape is basically that of an elongated cone. (Children will find this design fun and whimsical knit in bright and sparkly colors like a unicorns horn!)

**Diagrams:** This pattern comes with instruction along with a detailed vector diagram for both color placement and knitting order.

**Sizing:** This design comes with instruction for knitting five different sizes described as XS-XL based on length as follows: XS - 127cm (50""), S - 152cm (60""), M - 178cm (70""), L - 203cm (80""), and XL - 229cm (90""). Width runs from 27cm (10.5"") to 42cm (16.5""). All dimensions are approximate and will vary depending on final gauge and blocking.

**Floats:** The nature of this design requires a lot of slipping stitches to move the design from the smallest shape to the largest shape. Because of this, you could need to sew in a number of ends after the piece is complete. Options for working with these ends is included in the pattern.

While this pattern is recommended for experienced knittters, adventurous beginners will enjoy the fluid nature of the design and once wraps + turns have been mastered, it will become an enjoyable project and statement piece for your collection.

While the texture of this scarf resembles a maze, the directions are straight-forward and easier than you might guess! You can use one or many colors, and an icord edging provides a finished look, and also a subtle way to hide the carried yarn.

This pattern is easily adaptable to other yarn weights - just choose a needle size that is 1-2 sizes larger than that recommended for your yarn in order to achieve a nice drape. As written, scarf measures approximately 6 inches wide and 70 inches long. The pattern stitch count can be adjusted in multiples of 6 stitches. The length can be adjusted by simply knitting more or fewer rows. 

The ends can be carried up the sides of the scarf and hidden in the icord edging, although I chose to cut mine and weave them in when changing colors more than every 4 rows. 

I have provided the color stripe sequence that I used for my first sample, but you can easily use one or many colors depending on your needs. I also made a second scarf with color blocks, working 2 full repeats of the 16 row pattern for each color. This did require cutting each yarn color when the new color is added in, but the result is lovely.

One of my testers adapted also this pattern to make a baby blanket!

Read a little more about my project here:

Welcome to my quest! The idea for this ebook was born while reading posts on Ravelry: people knitting 10 shawls in 2010. I kept musing about all of those knitters stretching themselves, and I wondered about challenging myself to design 10 shawls in 2010. I had already designed and knit 3 shawls, and I am becoming addicted to small shawls made of sock yarn. My sock yarn stash is growing. And growing. I decided to jump in! I’m starting late, and I have 7 shawls to go before the end of this year. Can I do it? We shall soon find out!

***Update December 31, 2010: I have attained my goal! Today, I finished and blocked the 7th and last shawl for the eBook. The last three shawls have not been released yet, but will be released to you as soon as my test knitters have finished them! Thank you so much for joining me in the adventure!!***

When you subscribe to this ebook, you will receive periodic notices that there is a new pattern ready. Just go to the link provided and download your next copy of the book. Each update will include the past patterns, as well, so there is no need to keep lots of files. The update file will completely replace any older files.

Each of the shawl patterns will also be sold separately, but when you buy the entire collection as an ebook, you will also get other small patterns sprinkled here and there–at least 3 extras! Those extra projects will not be available for purchase alone. And with an ebook purchase, you'll already be getting at minimum 3 of the shawl patterns free, as well!

Each of the 7 shawls in this book is named after one of the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters of Greek mythology–nymph companions of Artemis–turned into stars to save them from Orion’s pursuit. Follow along with me – I'll be [blogging][2] the progress I make through the design process: imagining, swatching, charting, testing and laying out the patterns while trying to live a normal life!

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

Knit entirely in garter stitch from end to end—not a purl in sight—it’s a great stash buster for small amounts of finely spun handspun or single skeins of commercial sock yarn. Exact gauge is not critical, and you can weigh your skein before you begin and customize the length to use the yardage you have on hand. You can easily substitute commercial yarn—a 100-gm skein of sock yarn is perfect but lace- or sport-weight yarns will work, too.

If you have any trouble understanding the pattern, I hope [this][1] blog post will help.

When a heavy scarf just won't do, grab this gossamer-weight lace scarf instead! The silk/kid mohair blend lace-weight yarn knit on size 9 needles creates a supremely soft scarf.

An open lace panel with gentle peaks along one long edge is contrasted with a bit of garter stitch for lots of textural interest.

This scarf is very light, yet has enough body to allow itself to be draped in many pretty ways.

Wrap it around your neck like a cowl and tuck in the ends, drape it around your neck with the ends drawn through the folded middle loop, or tie it askew with a loose knot – it will always add a nice touch of femininity to your outfit.

PLUS, it's knit from just one ball of Elann.com Silken Kydd yarn. . . making it an ideal gift knit or quick knit for yourself!

“Aquinnah’s design was inspired by the rocky shores of the Brannock Islands on the northwest end of the Aran archipelago, windswept and lonely. A solitary lighthouse serves as a reminder of the Aran fishing tradition, and of the families who waited for the fishermen to return home.” – *Kerry Robb*

Aquinnah wraps you in plush warmth and classic cable motifs: five-rope Aran braids and honeycomb cables. Four-stitch cabled twists and little strands of twisted rib punctuate the primary motifs and vary the scale; I-cord stabilizes the long edges and keeps the look clean and linear. The pattern offers three different sizes of wrap: a small stole in *Shelter*, a wider version in *Quarry*, and a 7-foot magnum opus in *Shelter* large enough to cuddle into with a loved one. Choose a color that coordinates with your home design, as you’ll want to leave this handsome accessory draped over your favorite chair to admire when you’re not wearing it.

The piece is knit end-to-end and finished with an i-cord edge for a clean border and an additional opportunity to use up more leftover yarn. Alternatively, skeins of your favorite fingering weight yarn can be substituted for one or both of the color groupings of scraps.

792693,Snowflake Muffler,Churchmouse Yarns and Teas,2.73,21.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,,"The snowflake motif sprinkled at each end of this scarf has a traditional Nordic look that transports us to snowy fields and alpine vistas. It’s worked in the round from both ends, then grafted in the center so that the wee v’s of lice stitch face the right direction on both sides! This scarf has double the thickness, double the warmth, and easily hides the strands from your colorwork. Plus, the drifting flakes and flurries are handsome for both him and her!

We chose two colors from the sweeping color palette of [Brooklyn Tweed Arbor][1]. Firmly spun at a DK-weight, Arbor is a classic workhorse of a yarn that is entirely produced in the United States. The round, 3-ply composition creates firm fabric with great stitch definition and light, woolly softness—and it makes a soft, bouncy scarf perfect for a day filled with flurries!

----------------------

FINISHED SIZE
Approx. 9""/23cm across (half the circumference) x 52""/132cm long, after blocking.
*Note: Scarf is knitted in the round as a tube, making it easy to knit and double warm to wear.*

YARN
6 skeins [Brooklyn Tweed Arbor][2] (145 yds/132m each): 5 in Main Color (MC), 1 in Contrast Color (CC). Shown in MC Kettle and CC Hammock.
Or, approx. 835 yds/663m total of an equivalent DK-weight yarn: 725 yds/663m in MC and 110 yds/100m in CC.

NEEDLES & NOTIONS
US 6 (4mm) 16""/40cm circular needles, or size to obtain gauge.
Note: If you find your gauge is different on the solid color section, you may change needle size so it more closely matches the stranded two-color section.
Spare needle in gauge size or smaller, for grafting.
6 stitch markers, including 1 in a contrast color to designate beginning of round.
Darning needle to finish.

GAUGE
Approx. 21 sts/28 rows = 4"", in stockinette stitch in the round.

Playful, striking, or purposeful — your palette choice will determine the mood of this chevron scarf. Bevel can be worked in Loft for lightweight warmth or in Arbor for greater drape and heft as well as a larger size. The pattern calls for three contrast colors, but using scraps in a gradient or as bright accents opens up limitless possibilities.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Construction**
* This scarf is worked in a modular fashion. The center (chevron section) of the scarf is worked first, beginning with two setup triangles that are joined together on the WS before beginning the main chevron section of the scarf. The outer side borders are picked up and worked outwards from the center section of the scarf in two separate flat parts. Next, the top and bottom borders are picked up and worked from the top or bottom edge of the scarf, plus from the edges of the side borders.
* After the center section of scarf is finished, the side borders are picked up and worked in Color 1. When side borders are complete, Top and Bottom borders are picked up and worked across stitches of center scarf and both side edgings.

Make a delicate, sheer Demi Lune Scarf with an airy lace-weight yarn, like [Rowan Kidsilk Haze][1]. For more drape and less sheerness, pair a fingering-weight yarn with a lace-weight yarn, like Shibui’s [Reed][2] with [Silk Cloud][3].

SIZE: 13.25"" x 62.5"" 

MATERIALS: 

Expression Fiber Arts Yarn Kit: [Wine Country Hues][3]

Virtually any combination of yarn weights or colors can be used. We used a total of 605 yards for the shawl, tassel and i-cords.

NEEDLES: 

US 8 (5.0 mm) 9"" straight needles (recommended) [you could use US 8 (5.0)mm 24” (min.) circular needles]
US 5 (3.75 mm) double pointed or circular needles, for icord

Advanced Beginner -  This pattern is for those who are ready to learn new techniques.

**Designed by Jane Vanselous**

Notes From the Designer:

•This knit utilizes a fun technique that may be used to produce a wide variety of effects. Using 3 different yarns and knitting just one row with each, the correct yarn is always where it needs to be to work the next row. The yarns may be different colors and different weights. In this design, we chose 3 different yarns that are all in the same color.

•With the addition of a few knitted i-cords and/or well placed seams, this may be worn as a scarf, shawl, cowl, 2 types of poncho, head scarf, and shrug. 

•The stitch pattern is very easy to work and produces a soft, stretchy fabric. 

•Like the many varieties of wine, there is surely a yarn combination and way to wear this that will please just about anyone!

•Watch a video [here][4] showing you 7 ways to style this pattern!

Castel and Castelette are richly colored, gauzy parallelograms that use lots of colors in a preset marl sequence. All you have to do is choose 13 colors of lace for Castel (or 11 for Castelette) and then assign letters to each color. 

If you have a copy of Making Marls, you don't need this pattern (Castelette is a skinny Castel using the SOS table for 2 strands and 11 colors in the Appendix). If you have the kits from Imagiknit in San Francisco, the pattern is included with each kit.

---------------------

**Myriad Stars** Shawl is inspired by one of my favorite paintings - Vincent Van Gogh’s Starry Night.

*""I don't know anything with certainty, but seeing the stars makes me dream.”*- Quote By Vincent van Gogh

There are many interpretations of this painting and one is that Starry Night depicts hope. It seems that Van Gogh was showing that even with a night such as this it is still possible to see the light in the windows of the houses. With shining stars filling the sky, there is always light to guide you.

How Van Gogh captured “sincere human feeling” in his art so that it still evokes such an emotional response over a hundred years later is a mystery to me. In this pattern, I've tried to bring the essence of the ever-changing sky and the movement of the stars.

Myriad Stars is a top-down shawl that worked mostly in garter stitch, with eyelets, German short rows, and short row lace. 

**YARN:** 

* (MC): One Gradient Set in Miss Babs Yummy 2-ply Toes, 
(six 133 yd/121m per 1.3 oz/38g skeins) shown in Orion.
* (CC): One skein Miss Babs Yummy 2-ply of contrast color,  
(400 yd / 3.9 oz (365m/ 110g) skein) shown in Goldenrod.

Or approximately 420 yards of MC and 245 yards in CC of fingering weight yarn.

**NEEDLES:** US #6 / 4 mm (or as required to get the gauge)

**NOTIONS:** darning needle, 1 marker

**GAUGE:** 19 sts x 33 rows = 4” in garter stitch on US 6

**SIZE** (wet blocked and relaxed): wingspan 86” x depth 19”

**ERRATA has been added to the pattern file:**

This scarf is inconceivably different on each side. There were just too many quotes that needed to be included! 

Because of the two-pattern nature of the scarf, this is not a good pattern if you have never attempted double knitting. However, it may not be as hard as you think! I have made a tutorial for double knitting, as well as a short video about how to read a two sided chart. View the videos [here][1].

You will need two colors of light fingering weight yarn (about 430 yards of each color) and size 2 (2.75mm) needles. The finished model scarf is 5.5” wide and 62” long.

Are you a Wednesday or an Enid? Or neither, cause you haven't seen the show and have no clue what I'm talking about? Either way, we hope you like this garment inspired by the runaway hit Netflix series Wednesday!

Inspo came from the Gates of Nevermore Academy, the Raven Dance (by now you know 'the' dance!) and of course, the 'snoods' from the show—they were crochet, so we decided to do them the knit way! 

Cowl/Snood/Infinity scarf (however you want to wear it!) measures about 8"" wide with a circumference of 60"" or 30"" laid flat folded once into a rectangle.

1322441,Kylie Head & Neck Scarf/Band,Danyel Tacker,2.75,20.0,2.0,Stockinette,100.0,"The Kylie Head & Neck Scarf is a super-quick knit accessory. I designed this for my beautiful niece, when she admired the Versatility Head & Neck Scarf. Then after I finished hers (the prototype), I decided to scale it to a wider option as well. I also decided to add a closed-circle/head-or-neckband option - for those of us who like the hands-free things in the world.  If you have never created i-cord edging or cabled - give a Kylie a try. Only 7-12 cables are completed in the whole project (for an adult-sized project), and the tails and edges are i-cord, so it’s a great, low-commitment way to try them out.

As with my other Head & Neck scarves, Kylie starts with an i-cord tail/tie, increases to a desired width, and is worked flat to the desired length; decrease back to the i-cord stitch-count, and finish the other i-cord tail/tie. If you want to make this a band, you omit the i-cord on the other side and graft the tip of the i-cord tail already completed to the base of the decrease.

This is a shoulderette, but it is written to be easily enlarged by repeating the first chart. Knit from the top back of the neck down, Celaeno is shaped as a shallow triangular shawl that nestles around your shoulders.

Blocked dimensions are 54 x 18 inches. Please note that I knit lace at a fairly loose gauge and I also block lace very vigorously. Depending on the fiber you use, you may experience varying degrees of bounce-back.

The pattern is available as a stand-alone pattern or as part of the eBook collection (stand alone pattern to be released late September). **All shawls will include both written and charted instructions.** Read a little more about my project here:

Welcome to my quest! The idea for this ebook was born while reading posts on Ravelry: people knitting 10 shawls in 2010. I kept musing about all of those knitters stretching themselves, and I wondered about challenging myself to design 10 shawls in 2010. I had already designed and knit 3 shawls, and I am becoming addicted to small shawls made of sock yarn. My sock yarn stash is growing. And growing. I decided to jump in! I’m starting late, and I have 7 shawls to go before the end of this year. Can I do it? We shall soon find out!

***Update December 31, 2010: I have attained my goal! Today, I finished and blocked the 7th and last shawl for the eBook. The last three shawls have not been released yet, but will be released to you as soon as my test knitters have finished them! Thank you so much for joining me in the adventure!!***

When you subscribe to this ebook, you will receive periodic notices that there is a new pattern ready. Just go to the link provided and download your next copy of the book. Each update will include the past patterns, as well, so there is no need to keep lots of files. The update file will completely replace any older files.

Each of the shawl patterns will also be sold separately, but when you buy the entire collection as an ebook, you will also get other small patterns sprinkled here and there–at least 3 extras! Those extra projects will not be available for purchase alone. And with an ebook purchase, you'll already be getting at minimum 3 of the shawl patterns free, as well!

Each of the 7 shawls in this book is named after one of the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters of Greek mythology–nymph companions of Artemis–turned into stars to save them from Orion’s pursuit. Follow along with me – I'll be [blogging][1] the progress I make through the design process: imagining, swatching, charting, testing and laying out the patterns while trying to live a normal life!

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

""A beautiful wardrobe item for Fall layering that will keep you warm through winter, this luxurious rectangular lace stole was inspired by my travels to the Shetland Islands. Celes is a lace stole with a traditional construction: a central lace panel is worked first in two halves and then grafted together at the center using kitchener stitch, allowing for mirrored vertical motifs up either side. The piece is finished by way of a knitted-on lace edging that frames the entire rectangle which is attached to the entire perimeter of the stole as it is worked."" - Jared Flood

***THE INSPIRATION***

Learning to brioche was such a huge struggle for me. There are a good number of YouTube videos that teach brioche knitting, but I prefer photo tutorials, and there really aren’t many out there for knitters who want to learn this technique. With this pattern, I set out to demystify brioche knitting through photos so that even a beginner can learn!


***THE CONSTRUCTION***

The Better Than Sex Brioche Cowl features a gorgeous staggered stripe pattern in a two-color brioche knit in the round. The best part about this design? It's completely REVERSIBLE! All the photos in this listing feature the same cowl, so you basically get two in one!


***THE YARN***

I used the amazing hand-dyed Subculture Yarn SW Merino Worsted Single Thick & Thin in the colorways ""Ocean Purl"" and ""Black Pearl."" The colors are just magical and complement eachother perfectly! I also love the base, which is a deliciously squishy single-ply merino wool. It has a gorgeous, slightly thick-and-thin texture to it, so the weight varies from DK to worsted weight. Unfortunately, it looks like this yarn is being discontinued, but there are lots of other good quality single-ply wools out there that are perfect for this pattern. I recently made a shop sample for my local yarn store, Stars Hollow Yarns, using Manos del Uruguay Maxima, [available online here.][1]


***MATERIALS***

* 130 yards (119 m) of Color 1 and 160 yards (146 m) of Color 2 in a DK (3) to worsted (4) weight yarn.

* US size 5 (3.75mm) 16"" circular knitting needles, or size needed to obtain gauge

* Basic notions such as stitch markers, a yarn needle, and scissors


***MEASUREMENTS***

Approximately 25"" (64 cm) around and 10"" (25 cm) tall


***GAUGE***

16 sts x 48 rounds = 4"" (10 cm) in main stitch pattern

In fact, it’s made up entirely of knit and purl variations! The fabric also has a tendency to gently pleat itself, making it look even fancier. Isn't it amazing what you can create out of just knits and purls?

Knit from end to end, Subtlism is incredibly easy to customize. It will work with many different yarn weights and colorways as well as for many different accessory sizes, so you can customize to your heart's content. The pattern is for the sample shown, but you can easily modify the length, width, and even yarn weight to suit your preference. The pattern includes a link to a free planning worksheet to help you plan your version.

**Wine Not** shawl is only looking complicated, but actually, it is straight forward knitting. Only one color per row. Garter stitch and mosaic knitting that easy to memorize. Nothing that needs constant attention. 

The shawl is a parallelogram made out of triangles. You'll make one, then pick up stitches for the next one, and so on. A slip stitch edging is worked on all sides of each section, which makes the outer edge neat and stretchy. Mosaic rows can be worked from written instructions or charts.

I wear this type of cowl 3 seasons out of the year in northeast Minnesota - for me, it stands up without sagging down to block the wind so my hands can be warm in my pockets.  I've written the pattern to be made in one size with a single 90-yard skein of super bulky yarn, but instructions for easily adapting it are included.

Just as that rain clears out,  all the weeds...I mean FLOWERS arrive. Truly, hidden amongst all the weeds fighting for dominance over our rocked front yards are some actual flowers that are intended to be there, and even some that are not.  This asymmetrical triangle shawl has the flowing waters of the monsoon worked throughout in a beautiful wavy lace pattern and ends with a panel of blooming lace flowers (weeds not included). 

FINISHED MEASUREMENTS - if no adjustments are made
46.5"" long X 38"" wide (118cm long x 96.5cm wide) - at the longest points from the flower panel to the bottom curve and at the widest point across the flower panel

MATERIALS

Yarn: Coastal by Sincere Sheep ( 50% Shaniko wool/ 25% Mulberry silk/ 25% Belgian linen - 2.0oz/56g, 205yds/224m) in 4 colors. I have provided for 8% overage compared to the gauge
provided. When in doubt, purchase an extra skein. As used in the sample, they are as follows:

A: Suerte - 178 yards (1 skein, used as beginning color of shawl.)

B: Bud Break - 200 yards (Each skein is 205 yards of the Costal by Sincere Sheep, if you are at all worried about getting gauge, get 2 skeins. Used as middle color in main part of shawl.)

C: Bare - 210 yards (Almost the entire skein was used, if you are at all worried about getting gauge, get 2 skeins. Used as last color in main part of shawl.)

D: May Day - 135 yards (1 skein, used for Flower Panel only.)

Total Yards = 723 yards

Needles: US 6 (4mm) needles - The designer used 32"" (81cm) circular needles.

Stitch Markers: At least 1. Three (3), if you wish to mark the borders of the Flower Panel or the I-cord edges. If you find it helpful to use markers to indicate repeats within a lace pattern, you may
wish to have 15 markers set aside for this as well.

Tapestry Needle: To weave in ends

Row Counter: You may find it helpful to have 2, 1 to keep track of the Row and 1 to keep track of the Panel (or section) you are on.

GAUGE
20 sts and 28 rows in stockinette on US size 6 (4mm) over 4"" (10cm) each after blocking.

For warmer climates or warmer seasons, everyone loves wearing a light-weight scarf. But it’s difficult to find a pattern that isn’t too feminine or dainty. This addicting pattern utilizes knit and purl stitches to create a geometric motif which anyone can wear. The stitch texture adds interest and depth to the fabric and also looks great on both sides.

How much more versatile can a scarf be? Reversible. Light-weight. Unisex.

Instructions are charted and written, making this a good project for beginners learning to follow a stitch pattern or pros looking for an easy-to-memorize chart.

**Finished Dimensions**
Length: 65” / 165cm
Width: 8” / 20.5cm

**Note**
Garter stitch naturally has a looser gauge than ribbing and seed stitch. Therefore while you are knitting, the garter stitch sections of the scarf will be slightly wider than the non-garter stitch sections. With lace weight or fingering weight yarn, this variance easily blocks out, giving the final scarf an even edge.

However, with heavier yarns this may not be the case. If you are concerned with how your yarn will behave, work up and block a swatch. If the scarf edges do not even out and this bothers you, simply switch to a smaller needle when working the garter stitch sections. This will give you a tighter gauge which is more consistent with the rest of the scarf and therefore will straighten up the edges.",6.0,70,208,4.38,"approximately 8"" x 65"" blocked",Fingering

The cable starts and ends in a pair of points, like the tips of a flame. To do this, fewer stitches are cast on and then increases are worked to make the points.

This scarf was designed for my brother-in-law, and if you’d ever seen him and my husband eat a pile of barbeque, you’ll know the other reason this scarf is named Logi!

This scarf uses TWO hanks of Eco Wool but leaves plenty of yardage for making up a pretty pair of mittens to match. (That's another pattern coming soon!)

The scarf itself is nice and long for wrapping around but you can easily knit more repeats to lengthen it further. The hood is picked up and knit flat, then seamed at the top.

I incorporated a pretty ""Lateral Braid"" into this garment to separate the ribbing from the complex panels of cabling and lace. I've included a link to a helpful video tutorial on this fun and unique method:

The days shorten and evenings lengthen. We take on the 'gathering', like the animals of the woodlands.

We freshen our garden beds, making them ready for the cold months ahead. We rake and clean the remnants of leaves, pine cones, grasses, and lush foliage, that has given up its summer beauty.

And nothing could be eloquent than to share in the harvest with knitting ""GATHERING AUTUMN'S SPLENDOR"". This biased scarf/""thingie"" is simple in design, the amazing depth of color changes in the yarn add incredible detailed texture, with optional beading for some glitter.

What a lovely time of year, as one season gives way to another.

We can cherish the good times, with the lovely brilliant colors of Fall. The array of color changes in the yarn, lends to delight and is a spectrum rarely seen except by the human eye.

The scarf/'thingie' is a long drape and flow of colors, just like the mountains and valleys. Each day paints new scenery and knitting this beauty adds to that color palette. As outdoor activities wind down, you'll have abundant beauty all around, to keep warm. A cup of cider or hot cocoa only adds to the ambiance.

The collection features 8 patterns intended to make good gifts for everyone on your knitworthy list (because life’s too short to knit for anyone who doesn’t love what you make).

**Hiraeth**
Every winter wardrobe needs an understated but refined scarf. This one has enough detail to keep the knitting interesting with a geometric cable pattern worked at either end. Both ends are fully charted so there’s no need to graft the centre in order to have matching ends. The cable patterning is confined to area most visible when worn, while the background is worked in a fast rib pattern made up of more knits than purls. The polished edging is simply worked with slipped stitches and stockinette, using the natural roll of stockinette for a rounded finish.

Hiraeth is written in two sizes: a wide wrap for cozying up in and a longer skinnier version perfect for wearing in a dapper woven knot.

*Stitch patterns are provided in chart format only.*

The scarf pattern is written to be more interesting to knit and wear than a garter stitch scarf, and I was so pleased that the simple slip stitch texture is still definitely beginner friendly.

Sometimes all you want is a simple project that works up quickly, no muss no fuss. Knit with a super bulky yarn, this project works up fast and produces a cozy fabric that is sure to be a hit with any person who gets to try it on. This pattern would make a great first time project, and it even avoids purling!

The original scarf was knit with Cascade yarn's Lana Grande, a super bulky yarn that creates a fabric that is both sturdy and soft enough to wear against the skin. It is spun of 100% Peruvian highland wool, which is a variety resulting from sheep bred with Corriedale sheep for strength and Merino for improved softness! Borgo de Pazzi Naturalia is another super bulky yarn that we carry that would make an amazing Boyfriendly scarf, or if you cast on an extra 4 stitches and use a smaller needle size, you can use any bulky yarn to knit the scarf at a smaller gauge. The Malabrigo Mecha, Estelle Eco Super Alapaca or Mirasol Yaya would all make incredibly soft and squishy scarves in bulky weight yarn!

655627,Mitered Rectangle Scarf,Margaret Radcliffe,0.0,18.0,4.0,garter stitch,,"This scarf is worked in garter stitch from the center out, alternating rounds of two colors in helix knitting. The rectangular shape expands on the idea of a mitered square. The long center section of the scarf is worked straight while two corners of a square are created at each end. Using two colors of yarn makes it easy to keep track of which pattern round you're on. The first color is used to cast on and to work the knitted increase rounds. The second color is used on the purl rounds. An advantage of using two colors is that helix knitting hides the beginning and end of rounds so there is no jog to be disguised, except where both yarns end at the bind off.

Join the chat in the [Epic Knits forum][1] or the [Discord][2]!

To celebrate the 3rd anniversary of Epic Knits, we're bringing your a brand new MKAL in a format never before seen - a Knitting RPG! The campaign will play out over 8 weeks, and we'll be knitting a very special mix and match scarf. What charts you knit will be determined through random numbers rolled either by dice or through a random number generator. Never played in an RPG before? No problem! There will be plenty of instructions to walk you through your adventure. We'll also be hosting a [forum thread][3] in the Epic Knits group to chat about our adventures.

***Special notes*** 
Before we get into the nitty gritty- This pattern can be knit in either double knitting or stranded colorwork in the round (or flat, if you prefer), instructions for both are included. No prior experience in tabletop RPGs is required, and if you prefer a static pattern there will be pre-made templates made that don't require you to do the RPG part. 

***What is a Knitting RPG (KRPG)?***
A Knitting Role Playing Game! 
The way this works is that I shall act as the Dungeon Master (Game Master) for a custom game of Yarn Quest - Heroes of Yarnia. The welcome letter comes with a couple of extra documents for determining your stats and the stats of your Feline companion. Starting January 1st I will release instructions for determining what charts to knit on your scarf. These charts will be randomized by each person using a set of character stats. There are several dozen charts, so everyone's scarf will be unique! 

***Character Sheets***
Included in the welcome letter you will find a set of character sheets and instructions for how to set up your character. Illustrated instructions for how to roll your character will be included in the [official Epic Knits MKAL thread][4] on 12-23 (Friday afternoon). 

***Dates of Note***
22 December 2016 - Pattern live with introduction, character sheet, and instructions for filling out character sheet.

29 January 2017 - Clue 5
5 February 2017 - Clue 6
12 February 2017 - Clue 7
19 February 2017 - Clue 8

***Materials*** 
For either Double Knit or Colorwork in the Round - 
800 yards of Main Color and 800 yards of Contrasting Color (1600 yards total) 
Stitch markers 
16"" US 2 - 2.75 mm needles - or size needed to obtain gauge 
Tapestry needle

***Special Equipment***
If you don’t have a set already, I highly recommend getting a set of 7 D20 gaming dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20). They can be found at your local game store (Games by James, etc) or through [Amazon][5] - Make sure you pick a set like this [one][6]~ (with the 7 different dice, pick whatever colors you like best!). 
If you don’t want to pick up a set of dice, sites like Random.org or random number generators will also work. There’s probably an app out there for dice rolls, because there’s usually apps for everything.

***Prize Drawing*** 
At the end of the MKAL there will be a prize thread posted for finished projects. All participants who post a picture of their finished piece will be entered into a prize drawing for a $10 gift card to my Ravelry store. Additional prizes may be added based on number of participants

***Final Info*** 
This is an intermediate level project, previous experience with chart reading is recommended.

Icon: A new angle on style. The interplay of triangular wedges in three colors and an ultrasoft fabric in Birch create a striking, substantial wrap.

Icon is worked flat in Stockinette Stitch using 1 strand of Birch. Short rows form wedges of color, and cause wrap to relax and become smaller after blocking. A Reverse Stockinette Stitch border prevents the edges of the wrap from curling.

803011,KnitWit Temperature Scarf,Suzie von Reyn,1.33,,4.0,,,"This is the KnitWit yarn shop pattern for our 2018 Temperature Scarf. Inspired by temperature scarves we've seen our customers make in previous years, we wanted to create a version that used Quince & Co yarns (either Chickadee or Lark). 

Create 1 ridge a day by knitting 2 rows in the color that matches up to the high temperature the previous day (or same day if you’re knitting at night!). And if it snows, regardless of the temperature you’ll knit in white! You can also choose to still knit the temperature on snow days too (it's up to you!). Pattern includes the color options we came up with using Quince & Co yarn (both a colorful version as well as a neutral version). 

We chose 10 different colors (each color represents a ten degree increment) and white to represent snow (so 11 colors total).

Need to catch up on previous days? You can go to: [https://www.wunderground.com/history/][1] , [https://www.accuweather.com][2] (click on 'month' at top), or go to [https://weather.com/][3] (enter in your location, then scroll down & on the right side click on “Almanac”).

We carry yarns up the side (unless there is a big temp jump!) and when you cut the yarn, leave a long tail that you can weave in using the duplicate stitch (hides them the well with this technique). You can also pick up ends at the very end of the project if you're unhappy with how your sides look and work an icord edge or just a simple edge stitch.

Mac&Joe's second pattern is an adventure in garter stitch blending. The colors are gently stirred, never shaken. Worked flat from the center out in your choice of 3 or 4 colors. See page 4 for the 4 color modifications. 

Please note, all stitches are slipped purlwise with yarn in front.  When changing colors it is the designer's technique to slip the stitch in the old color and then change to the new color.  It moves the twist away from the edge making it very clean.  

This pattern is made for the unicorns that love to play with colors and have a little fun while doing it!

**Inspiration** 
Inspired by my love for mythology, J.R.R.Tolkien books, The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings films and, of course, Game of Thrones. So, if you have similar interests - this project is for you!

**Shape** 
It is a triangular shape design, wrapped around the neck with a closure at front. This is one skein project, but trust me - it’s not going to be a boring one! Keep in mind that blocking plays a big role, so your piece will get into its final shape only after the blocking.

**Needles** 
I used US2.5/3.00mm & US1/2.25mm ChiaoGoo Twist 32”(82cm) circular needles. Stitches should be firm, not loose. Adjust needle size if needed.

**Notions**

1119042,One Row Scarf: the remixes (vol. 1),jacqueline chenerous,0.0,,4.0,,400.0,"I’ve been pondering Yarn Harlot’s One Row Handspun Scarf.  What is it that makes it so magical and what might happen if we play around with the elements of the pattern?  What other things might we find using one row patterns with a small number of stitches (making it easy and reversible)?  

The remixes (vol. 1) also uses a 4-stitch repeat but moves the twisted rib stitch on the WS away from the rib on the RS, making it some sort of mistake stitch variant.  The pattern is: a twisted rib, followed by a regular garter stitch, followed by the back of the twisted rib on the WS, followed by a twisted garter, then repeat. The result has a pleasing waviness — it undulates — and a nice, nubby texture. I just want to touch it.

The watchword for the scarf is accessibility — a super simple knit pattern worked up with cheap-o yarn.  I tried steam blocking it but, honestly, it looks great without (most of the pictures of it were taken before blocking).  It drapes well and feels great using Caron Simply Soft, and the tweed effect in the yarn obscures any mistakes you might make.

1120240,Destination Scarf,Mary Jane Mucklestone,2.36,13.0,4.0,Stockinette stitch,,"[Modern Daily Knitting Field Guide No. 17: Lopi is like a trip to Iceland, without the hassle of a flight.][1]

Léttlopi is happy at many gauges. When we loosen the ballband-prescribed gauge, the resulting fabric is lighter, loftier, a revelation. As you work your way through the colors and the simple stranded transitions between them, you’ll acclimate to this new way of knitting Léttlopi. Light, cozy, fluffy—and beautiful.

[Shop the kits for the Destination Scarf right here.][2]

**Materials**
— Léttlopi by Lopi \[50 g skeins, each approx 109 yds (100 m), 100% Icelandic wool\]
— 1 skein each of 5 or more colors; sample used Frostbite (A), Celery Green Heather (B), Lyme Grass (C), Pine Green (D), and Bottle Green (E)
— Size US 10 (6 mm) circular needle, 32"" (80 cm) long or longer, or size needed to achieve gauge
— Stitch marker

**Knitted Measurements**
— 14.75"" circumference × 70"" long (37.5 × 178 cm)

**Gauge**
— 13 sts and 18 rnds = 4"" (10 cm) over stockinette stitch, after blocking
— Note: Stranded row gauge varies from knitter to knitter. It is not essential to the success of this project to match the row gauge exactly.

**Size**
— One Size

**Notes**
— The Destination Scarf is worked in solid stripes, using a stranded motif (see page 14) to transition from one stripe color to another. Each stripe in the sample was knit until there was just enough yarn left to work the Fleur de Lis chart to transition to the next color. Choose your own colors and motif, and work the stripes as desired.
— We recommend you use the Magic Loop method (with a long circular needle rather than double-pointed needles), especially
if you are making the scarf instead of a swatch to try out a motif for the Destination Pullover. That way you will be using the same needle for both projects, and your results should be consistent.
— [To learn the Magic Loop method, see the video lesson on the MDK site.][3]

1140857,Star Lord,Dorothy Bulac-Eriksen,5.0,22.0,4.0,Garter,510.0,"The Star Lord is knitted lengthwise, with a giving but stable cast on and bind off.  German short rows are used to create contrast color wedges, and a hybrid of the 3-needle bind off is employed to tuck them back into place.  An attractive diagonal folding effect is achieved so that you have contrast color 'fins' on both ends.  The scarf can be made longer or shorter, depending on the number of cast-on stitches.  Note that when blocked (and you definitely need to block this scarf!), it lengthens and narrows.

Note:  If you've knitted any of my other designs, you'll know that I like to play with different weights of yarn in the same item.  Don't be scared, live on the wild side, like the Star-Lord!  But here are some guidelines:

The MC can be fingering to DK Weight, but your CC needs to be a fingering weight (and in all cases, not heavier than your MC).

Your MC and CC would be attractive in any combo, just make sure you can tell the difference between the two to make it easier when it's time to create the fins.  Alternatively, the maroon scarf shown is one color, but the metallic sheen of the CC versus the matte qualities of the MC helps you determine between the two.

Yardage requirements (approx):
Short scarf:  MC: 250 yds / 230m
                      CC: 180 yds / 165 m

Long scarf:  MC: 300 yds / 275 m

*Asawa* is worked flat from end to end. It incorporates cables, garter, and reverse stockinette. Garter stitch is not merely a background for the cables but is seamlessly integrated into the motif. The garter stitch and the cables equally contribute to the visual impact of the design. Choose Size 1 for an everyday scarf with flair, Size 2 for a bolder statement piece, or Size 3 for a lush wrap.

###**About the Pattern**

Inspired by colorful stained glass windows, the cats in the **Glass Cat Scarf** are formed from angular shapes for a subtle effect. Show off your artistic side with these gorgeous cats.

Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, showing opposite colors on each side. Use a color changing yarn paired with a solid color for a neat stained glass effect or use two solid colors for a more classic look.

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The pattern includes two options for scarf length, 60 inches (152 cm) and 72 inches (183 cm). The shorter length is best for kids or shorter adults, while the longer length is best for taller adults. The finished width is approximately 5.25 inches (13.3 cm). The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).

**YAYOI’S DREAM:**  
This shawl is named after Japanese artist Yayoi Kasuma. She is the top-selling female artist in the world. There is a documentary about her called Kusama: Infinity (2018) that tells her story.  I found the film both interesting and profoundly sad.   While brilliant, she struggled, as many women have, to be taken seriously in the art world.  Today she is well recognized, at her artistic beginning in the 1950’s this was not the case.  You may enjoy learning about her and her work.   ***The PIECE  ITSELF***… there is a polka dotted element to this patterning & a heart section in the center.  The wrong side is also interesting.  This is a combination accessory with the warmth of a scarf and the beauty and style of a cowl.  It is knit lengthwise  with increases in the style of a triangular shawl.  A fun twist on an old standard.

**YARN:**   
The design is meant to be worked in DK (light worsted) weight yarn. It could be worked in different weights.  If changing up the yarn, you will need to estimate yardage needed & I would suggest using a needle recommended on the yarn ball band, or one size larger.

**NEEDLES & GAUGE:**    
US 7 / 4.5 mm needles. The project it knit lengthwise; I suggest using the longest cable you can. 
GAUGE uses US 7 / 4.5 mm in Stockinette Stitch, before blocking. Since this item is not fitted, exact gauge relates to not running out of yarn. I tend to knit to with good tension and NOT loosely.  
GAUGE - 22 Sts to 4” & 24 Rows to 4”
*PLEASE check your gauge, as this uses most of your yarn and not checking may mean you will have trouble completing the project with only 200 grams.* 

**SIZE:** 
116"" or 9.67 feet LONG. And 4.5 to 6” wide. The scarf is designed to be wrapped around your neck once with each side. The Center worn on top to mimic a cowl & cover the scarf (as in photo).

**NOTIONS:**      
A yarn sewing needle or crochet hook for tucking in ends.  Markers, some removable.

**About the Pattern**
Mini skeins and scrappy patterns have been some of my very favorite knitting of my handcrafting journey. With the debut of my 10th mini skein pattern, I wanted to do something extra special. Traditionally, mini skein patterns are drapey and light- it's the nature of fingering weight yarn, after all! But aren't we all just craving a chunky, warm, cozy infinity scarf in the winter? I know I am, so that's exactly what Pinceaux de Monet is! It works up in the round and it's almost entirely built off the knit stitch. Thanks to the unique stitch it's composed of, it magically feels like it is made from a DK or worsted yarn. The pattern is basically a two round repeat, so it's easy to remember and bring with on your holiday adventures with friends and family. The colors transition in a type of fade, so whether you are working with stark contrasts, plotting your minis to fade, working with two full skeins, or using a combo of a full skein with minis, the transitions allow the colorway of your yarns to shine beautifully, as well as giving your whole project a cohesiveness that culminates in a scarf that resembles a Monet painting. Best of all, it only uses 40 yds of each color, so if you have 80+ yd minis, you have enough to add into a scrappy Cottagecore Throw Blanket!
Happy knitting and Happy Holidays! -SamBee

**Time**: about a weekend if you don’t have to many coffee breaks...

**Yarn**
I recommend yarn with some natural volume to keep the knit airy and dense.  
Tightly spun yarn will give you a result that is more mesh like, ideal for an airy spring/ summer scarf.

**Needle size**: play with different needle sizes to get a texture you like. - even one size up/down can make quite a difference.

- 20 sts and 40 rows = 4” is a blocked gauge. Before blocking, my gauge was 22 sts and 48 rows = 4”. Because of the silk content, Fino relaxes quite a lot in blocking. If your gauge is too big before blocking, you may run out of yarn.

It is a 7 stitch repeat over four rows, so quite easy to memorize.

The Amherst yarn stretches lengthwise quite a bit with wet blocking, so you may want to make your scarf shorter to compensate.  Any worsted or DK weight yarn would look good in this stitch pattern.

The pattern is written for chunky yarn because that is what her mother used. It would be possible to knit this with other weights. Just choose a needle that produces the desired fabric, and cast on an even number of stitches to give the desired width.

This tutorial gives step-by-step instructions for creating tassels: [https://bridgetpupillodesigns.com/2020/09/26/woodland-critters-scarf-making-tassels/][2]

And here is a tutorial for finishing the ends with pompoms:
[https://bridgetpupillodesigns.com/2020/10/03/woodland-critters-pompoms/][3]

Woodland Critters scarf is the capstone project for the Woodland Critters collection. It combines most of the animal designs with flowers, trees, and other woodsy motifs into a single tubular-knit scarf. This adorable sampler project is a great way to practice stranded knitting, duplicate stitch, and finishing techniques all in one garment. The pattern includes two versions of each chart: a complete chart, often with four colors per round, and a second chart with just two colors per round for those who choose to use the duplicate stitch method to add extra colors after knitting is complete. The pattern offers two finishing options: fringe tassels and pompoms.

This pattern includes two sizes: Child and Adult, with a length of 40 (60)” or 100 (152) cm not including tassels or pompoms. 

The gauge is 28 sts and 29 rows over 4” (10cm) in stranded Stockinette Stitch, blocked.

This is an intermediate level pattern. Knitters should have experience with stranded knitting technique, long carries, and following color charts. Since the motifs in this pattern call for up to four colors in a row, some knitters may opt to use the duplicate stitch technique.

For this design I used Knit Picks Palette(100% Peruvian Highland Wool; 231 yards/50g). To make either the adult or child scarf, you will need 1 ball each of Semolina (#24250), Masala (#24248), Teal (#24000), White (#23728), Marble Heather (#24244), Black (#23729), Bluebell (#24578), Doe (#24240), Hazelnut (#24563), Mulberry (#24571), and Edamame (#24257).

You will also need a set of 16”/40cm (for child size) or 24”/60cm (for adult size) circular needles in size US 4 (3.5 mm) or size to obtain gauge.

This pattern includes full color charts, two-color charts for optional duplicate stitch, written instructions, and notes on making tassels and pompoms.

I need something relatively simple, like this lace pattern, so that my hands can work the stitches but my brain can wander, pondering pros and cons of different options. After thousands of stitches I come to a decision–and end up with a lovely scarf to boot. 

Think it Through is designed to show off a six-color gradient set, with simple garter ridges separating colors. Every other row of the 10-stitch, 8-row lace repeat is a rest row, and after several repeats the lace pattern becomes intuitive, making this a great project to pick up when your mind is a bit distracted.

The extra wraps of yarn during the knits on one of the rows offer a beautiful and simple lace design. “No purls about it” uses only one hank of yarn and you can choose to work until you’re almost out of yarn or until you reach your desired length. This pattern is easily adaptable to be more narrow or wider simply by adding or subtracting in increments of six. 

This pattern is available to view on my website for free. The ad-free pdf comes with extra goodies: a chart, a ""recipe"" card for taking your pattern on the go and printable gift tags for gifting your make. This pattern has a video tutorial to help you along and has been tested. 

The yarn that I chose to use is Knit Picks “Muse” fingering weight yarn. You can use any fingering weight yarn that you like, but I do recommend using a yarn with a natural fiber blend that will allow the scarf to bloom when you block it.

***“Bubblemania”***  is a scarf knitted in a simple slipped stitch pattern. The scarf is fast and easy project. The pattern is quite addictive. The scarf takes just one ball of 2ply lace yarn, but can also be knitted in a heavier weight yarn.  The scarf can be easily turned into a cowl if desired.  Enjoy!

*Gauge:*
The gauge is not critical in knitting this scarf. Adjust your needle size to suite your yarn and achieve the size and the look of the scarf of your choice.

Whether you are sitting back drinking a martini or you have to leap onto a convenient snowmobile for a high speed chase, this scarf will keep you warm in style.

In the luxurious Llama and silk you get beautiful drape and sheen with a definite statement. Worked in an understated color combination or yarn a more daily-wear piece can be created. With additional yardage the scarf can be made as long as desired by simply repeating the main motif.

The mosaic color-work means that you are only working with one strand of yarn at a time, a considerably easier proposition. To create more movement in the color-work I have chosen to mix up the stockinette and garter on the return rows which adds to the interest and squooshy quotient of the scarf.

Within the first 14 rows, students learn how to knit, purl, and to combine the two in the same row for ribbing and double seed. 

Beyond beginners, it's a fun pattern to follow because the stitches change quickly and one doesn't tire of seeing what will come next. 

Choose from either a cowl 8"" x 23"" (needs to be seamed at the end) or a scarf 8"" x 50"" (can be made longer with more yarn).

Pattern stitch is a multiple of 4, so you can choose if you would like your cowl/scarf wider or skinnier.

Particularly when their interested include gaming and science fiction. This scarf came about when a friend asked me for a scarf, specifying that it include over 10 unique symbols from the game, MAGIC the Gathering. I was stumped for a few days not knowing how it was possible to incorporate so many specific and complex symbols. Many of them had colors associated with them. I chose to step back and simplify the design as much as possible. It is black and grey to simplify the color aspect and traditional fair isle techniques were incorporated to make the inspiration less obvious.

***The inspiration for this pattern came from MAGIC the Gathering. Magic: the Gathering, Wizards of the Coast, and their logos, the expansion symbols, the pentagon colors, and the mana symbols are property of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. in the U.S.A. and other countries.This pattern is for personal use only and due to copyright do not sell this pattern or any items knitted from this pattern.*** 

This scarf draws from the 10 guilds of Ravnica, the mana symbols, and Gatecrash symbols. 

By design, it is a rather long and wide scarf. With some creativity the width can be altered. The length can be controlled based on changing the number of repeated symbols, removing transition rows, adding or removing repeats of the mana symbols or adding new charts!

MATERIALS:

Expression Fiber Arts [Artistic Sport][3] and [Luster Sport][4] yarn

Shown in colors Innovative Artistic Sport and Belgian Chocolate Shavings Luster Sport.

You'll need 3 skeins of Artistic Sport or 2 skeins of Luster Sport.

If those colors aren’t available, any from [this category][5] will work.

NEEDLE: 

US size 3 (3.25 mm) 16” circular needles or size needed to obtain gauge

*The original version used US size 5 (3.75 mm) 16” circular needles. DPNs or longer circular needles will also work if you prefer to use the Magic Loop method instead.*

SKILL LEVEL: 

Beginner to Adventurous Beginner: For those knitters who are ready to learn some new skills or stitch combinations. Concepts include knitting in the round and knitting two stitches together (k2tog).

Notes From the Designer:

A simple, yet gorgeous tube scarf inspired by a trip I took to London. Before getting on the Tube, the announcer would say, “mind the gap between the train and the platform.” I loved it! I designed and tested this pattern while riding to see the Dover Castle and while on the plane trip back home. With this scarf pattern, you work around and around, which forms a tube, so no purling is required. You’ll have this whipped out in no time!

* The sample shown used approximately
  970 yards (887 m) total.
* The original version used approximately 790 yards
  (722 m) of Luster Sport in the color
  Belgian Chocolate Shavings.
* Click [here][6] to watch a tutorial on
  Jeny’s Surprisingly Stretchy Bind Off.
* Ideal for beginners who want to make
  something gorgeous!
* The size is adjustable. Want a fatter tube? Cast
  on more stitches. Want it shorter or
  longer? Just stop knitting when
  desired.
* Wonderful for both variegated yarn, as well as solids or
  tonals.
* You don't have to worry about
  running out of yarn. Just stop
  knitting when you want to.

NOTE
- This wrap is reversible, as both the RS and WS of the fabric create a lovely, interesting texture. When the colors switch, the RS and WS of the pattern will switch, but the RS and WS of the wrap itself will always stay the same. I would recommend marking the RS of the fabric with a removable marker to help you keep things straight.
- A bind-off occurs three times in this pattern. It is done twice as a design element when you change colors, and a third time when you complete the project.

The ‘wrong’ side has a more knitterly seed stitch look that’s gorgeous, too. Seemingly random striping sequences are quite forgiving—if you run out of a color, just throw in another!

We’ve designed the Wrap & Scarf for a DK-weight gauge yarn. For a woolly wrap with lots of drape, we’ve picked [Rowan Felted Tweed][1], and for a scarf with next-to-the-skin softness, we love [Blue Sky Fiber's Baby Alpaca][2].

779245,Braided Scarf,Xandy Peters,2.43,14.0,4.0,Garter Stitch,215.0,"**This pattern is also available as part of the Shifty Chevron Collection**

This scarf brings 3 simple concepts together into a more interesting, but easy to knit, scarf. Stripes provide color contrast; shaping bends the stripes into chevron patterns; and the final addition of short rows changes the thickness of each stripe. As the stripes become thick and thin, the proportion of colors changes,creating a braided look. Consider playing with self striping, ombre, speckled and variegated yarns for a completely different look.The instructions are for a heavy worsted weight yarn, but the pattern can be modified to fit any yarn weight using the following formula. 

This project has 2 sets of instructions with different advantages:
Knit/Purl – the edges are neater when the pattern is worked with some purl rows. In this version, the yarns travel up opposite sides of the work and do not need to break. 
All Knit – in this option, long loops are formed from carrying Color B up the side of the work or Color B breaks after each stripe and ends are woven in as you go. There is no purling in this version, but it is not as neat looking. 
Sample is worked using knit/purl instructions.

938969,Knitted 1800s Hat-Scarf,Felicia Kulp,2.25,12.0,2.0,,1200.0,"This is my knit version of a one piece hat-scarf based on the hat-scarf worn by 19th century Frenchman Charles-Marie-Étienne Champion Dubois de Nansouty (pictured on the left; image from Wikipedia). He was a military man turned mountaineer who lived from 1815-1895. I discovered his picture at an event hosted by the National Park Service in Maryland and knew I had to recreate his hat-scarf.

The yarn I used is: 
Lion Brand Yarn Fishermen’s Wool, Natural (MC) – 1.25 skeins, 580 yds.

1034332,Our Checkered Past,Trudy Fedorko,2.33,24.0,4.0,Garter Stitch,1300.0,"“Our Checkered Past” is a long, dramatic, textured and fun-to-knit scarf.  An easy to wear statement piece! The pattern uses five mini skeins for the contrast colors and two full skeins for the main color. Most of the scarf is done in relaxing garter stitch and garter stripes with a few sections of simple slipped stitches for interest. All the real work is done by the beautiful yarn you choose!  
 
*Pattern is worked end to end in long rectangle.
*If you prefer a shorter scarf, decrease the number of rows in the Garter Stitch Sections. 
*If you prefer a narrower scarf, cast on less than the 91 stitches called for. But make sure you cast on an odd number.

HAPPY KNITTING!!!

Trudy

Note: The spacing between the striped sections is slightly different in the written pattern as compared to the sample shown. This was altered so the yarn amounts would come out evenly and would not necessitate a third skein of MC. The overall look is the same though and the scarf is same size.

The Buena Vista scarf is knit on the bias, alternating strands of wool and mohair, with an occasional row of eyelets for interest. This pattern is easily adaptable for a cowl, simply begin with a provisional cast on, work to the desired length, and then join the ends with either Kitchener stitch or a three needle bind off.

**Notes From the Designer, Jane Vanselous:**

•For knitters who are looking to expand their skills, I think that cables are a great technique to learn. Simply a way to rearrange the order in which stitches are worked, cables provide a big impact without needing to work any difficult stitches. When the cables are comprised of reversible stitch patterns, very interesting effects may be achieved on both sides of the piece.

 •Contains both written and charted directions.

 •This **unisex** pattern provides instructions for 4 pieces: a hat, cowl, scarf and fingerless gloves. Choose one, or make them all. Great for any adult or teen on your gift giving list!

 **They are all two sided, providing very different looks when you reverse them**. I hope you enjoy both knitting and wearing them!

•Watch a video [here][4] to learn the German Twisted Long Tail Cast on method used in this pattern set.

*This pattern is available free. Please add it to your favorites ❤️ when you download it. Thank you and enjoy!*

Miss Purl is a lovely new yarn shop on the south side of Chicago. I first heard on Instagram of this shop opening and was so happy to learn about it! I started following Miss Purl and commented with encouragement as I saw the shop come together. During a few DMs with Kamaca, the shop owner, I wondered how I could lend support to her efforts. I offered to design a couple of patterns for Miss Purl, and this is the first of them. I hope you like it. If you’re in the Chicago area, or traveling through, be sure to stop by Miss Purl and show her some love. 

This scarf is easy to knit and would be a good project for knitters of any skill level, especially beginners. It's perfect for social knitting. It’s garter stitch, with an occasional easy eyelet pattern. 

A big thank you to Andrea for modeling!

1243903,Good Karma Scarf,Diane L. Augustin,2.33,5.0,1.0,stockinette,312.0,"**Good Karma Scarf**
I set out to find a simple definition of the word Karma, only to discover that it is more complex than I could have imagined. I had always thought of Karma as the effect of doing good in the world and good coming back to you. It is, and there’s much more. A quick internet search revealed that Karma has multiple definitions and meanings – much to study if you are so inclined.
This yarn is a marvelous blend of textures and colors – a feast for the eyes and fingers. Adding beads makes it more fun and fabulous.
Generate good Karma by knitting one for a family member or friend. It’s a perfect warm weather knit!
May you always have Good Karma. Enjoy!

**Materials** 
One skein of Lang Yarns, Karma, 312 yards. 
The sample in the pictures is color #0004.
42% Cotton/25% Viscose/25% Acrylic/8% Linen.
Size 7 needles, circular or straight, in any length. 
It is knit flat.
60 grams of TOHO 6/0 round beads. (I made a three-color bead mix for this project. The beads are strung in no color order.)
1.3mm (US10) steel crochet hook for the beaded 
bind off.
Bead stringing materials. 
(Beads are totally optional, too.)

**Pattern Notes**
It is approximately 5 1/4” wide x 70” long. 
Gauge: Approximately 5 sts./in. and 6 rows/in. 
Gauge is not critical for the project.
The scarf is knit flat. There is a Right Side (RS) and Wrong Side (WS). Place a locking stitch marker on the right side to identify it.
Cast on with beads. Bind off with beads using a small steel crochet hook. Beads are optional, and they are fun, 
so why not try it? Except for the cast on and bind off, the beads are placed in the body of the scarf on WS rows between two knit stitches. They will be prominent on the RS of the work. There are 15 beads in the body rows and 29 beads each for the cast on and bind off. String approximately half the number of beads onto the yarn. You will need to cut the yarn and string the remaining beads after you use up the first half. (The beads are optional, of course.)
Place a ring marker after the first repeat in Section 3, Row 5. Move the marker as you knit to it for all subsequent rows. This will help you to stay on track.

[Three Birds Yarn Studio][1]**

  
This worsted weight ‘Happy Days Shawl’ is all about showcasing variegated yarn. It is a kite shawl that uses 4 colors and has a mixture of garter stitch and broken garter stitch texture. Choosing colors for this shawl is the best part! Here is how I chose my complementing colors:

I chose a variegated yarn for the main color A, that is for the solid color garter sections. Color B is a very light color, mine is almost white, for the raised garter stripes. For colors C and D (and this is the fun part), I picked solid colors that are tones pulled from the variegated color A.

As with any design, feel free to get creative and use your own color combinations. You don’t have to stick to my formula. This pattern is very versatile, and you can use more than 5 colors or less. (Please note that the yardage will change). You can get creative and use a new color for every color A section or even swap colors for the stripes for color B. I have included a blank schematic on the final page so you can visualize how your shawl will look in its entirety. Feel free to even color in the blank areas to get the full idea. Whichever way you organize your colors, I hope you will enjoy the knitting process and design a shawl that you will be proud to wear.

The yarn is an artisan laceweight from Skylark Yarns called Les Oiseaux. The colorways are beautiful and subtle, and the whole scarf took one skein of the yarn.

This simple lace pattern is easy to memorize and easy to work.  When you reach the ruffles, the pattern grows seamlessly from lace to increases that create the ruffles.

The weight of the alpaca and soy fiber blend of this yarn creates a wonderful drape, which allows the ruffles to hang beautifully.",8.0,807,1689,4.54,8 inches (20 cm) wide and 60 inches (152 cm) long,Lace

Also available as a [knitCompanion design][1].

Just one skein needed to make this 80"" scarf.  Knit in 2 sections grafted together, it consists of a wide bias rib and very short short rows which create an indispensable, not to mention fun-to-knit cascade of ripples.  Challenging at the beginning, the pattern, once familiar, takes on it's own rhythm. Pattern also includes instructions for an easier - and nearly as awesome - short-row-free version.

Note to knitters: It may be helpful to divide yarn into 2 equal portions before knitting.

84295,Waves of Grain,Rosemary (Romi) Hill,3.64,24.0,4.0,,600.0,"*From the pattern:*

I love fall. It is my absolute favorite time of year. The sky is crisp bright blue, the fields have turned brilliant golden and orangey-red, and the leaves are shimmering red and orange and gold on the trees and in the vineyards. Around this time, a childhood favorite, the song ""America the Beautiful,"" is always on my mind, especially those ""amber waves of grain.""

This generously sized scarf was designed as a homage to this lovely time of year. Made of hand dyed laceweight alpaca in subtly shifting shades of gold and amber, the furrowed rows of grain in the body of the scarf end in long heads of barley.

This is a great first project to familiarize yourself with laceweight yarn and beads. Two identical halves with beaded ends are knitted and then grafted together in the middle. Although the ends will probably require more attention, the middle portion is a two-row repeat that can be memorized very quickly. The end result is much more impressive looking than it is difficult to knit: another one of my favorite things!",,521,1544,4.22,one size,Lace

236568,Vesna,Susanna IC,3.6,16.0,4.0,Stockinette Stitch,,"Inspiration for Vesna (poetic, meaning ‘spring’) comes directly from the beautiful Estonian stitches.  Their intricate shapes are evocative of nature in springtime, all fresh and new, bursting with flowers and leaves (CHART ONLY).

This pattern includes charts for both versions - a large rectangular wrap (20"" wide x 80"" long) and a crescent shawlette (16"" deep at center point x 62"" wide wingspan).

The rectangular stole is knitted in two halves from a center temporary cast on down to both ends.  The main body of the shawl is worked in a simple floral pattern, which flows seamlessly into the more elaborate border lace pattern.  This pattern features traditional nupps for added surface texture, but these can be replaced with beads or not worked at all.      

The shawlette is knitted in one piece starting with cast on at the top edge followed by easy short rows (no wraps), which give the shawl its crescent form.  Optional beads, reminiscent of sparkling dewdrops, add extra interest and texture to this project. 

**finished measurements:**
Stole: Width: 20” / 51 cm; length: 80” / 203 cm.
Crescent: Width: 16” / 40.5 cm; length: 62” / 157.5 cm.
All measurements are after blocking.

**suggested yarn:**
Stole: 1 skein SweetGeorgia Yarns Merino Silk Lace (765 yds / 700 m per 3 ½ oz / 100 g skein; 50% Fine Merino Wool, 50% Cultivated Silk) in Tourmaline.
Crescent: 1 skein SweetGeorgia Yarns Merino Silk DK (380 yds / 347.5 m per 3 ½ oz / 100 g skein; 50% Fine Merino Wool, 50% Cultivated Silk) in Pistachio.

**needles:**
Stole: Size 7 US / 4.5 mm circular needle, 32” / 80 cm long; size 8 US / 5 mm needle (for bind off only).
Crescent: Size 8 US / 5 mm circular needle, 32” / 80 cm long; size 9 US / 5.5 mm circular needle, 32” / 80 cm long; size 10 US / 6 mm needle (for bind off only).
Adjust needle size if necessary to obtain correct gauge.

Stole: Waste yarn for temporary cast on.
Crescent: 90 size 6/0 4 mm beads; crochet

through holes of beads).
Both: Tapestry needle, blocking pins.

272328,Find a penny,Lindsay Tabsh,1.94,18.0,4.0,stockinette Stitch,300.0,"Sometimes the pattern determines the yarn and other times the yarn determines the pattern. I happened upon this yarn at YarnCon in Chicago last year and instantly fell in love with it. When I saw the color’s name, Shiny Penny, I knew I had to design something with it. Seeing it across the room made me feel just like a little kid who happens upon a penny while walking down the street

This shawlett is constructed like most triangle shawls however I did it without the middle bit (standard cast on point) and started a few rows down to maximize the yardage and giving it a more natural shape for around the neck

I designed this to be knit with that one fancy skein of yarn in your stash (in my case that was [Grinning Gargoyle][1] Seda DK) that is just begging for a pattern that will do its beauty justice. The pattern is easily adjustable if you would like to make it a little bigger / smaller

The finished size has a 50 inch span and is 7.5 inches deep

The pattern also has two bind off options - the standard rolled edge or an optional picot edging!

The 3x3 rib on each end adds a hint of flare to the richly textured seed stitch body. Slipping the first stitch of each row gives it a nice edge and prevents it from stretching out of shape. 

The scarf in the photo was made with bulky yarn and 45 stitches in the cast on. It is 7.5"" x 66"" and used 3 skeins of yarn (3.5 oz, 120 yard skeins). Following the pattern as written will take 2 skeins of yarn a yeild a 5.5"" wide scarf with bulky yarn.

Play around with different yarn weights and patterns. Make it wider and use as a shawl/stole, or use dk weight, even fingering weight to make it lighter and airier. It's all up to you.

Do not feel constrained by the yarn and needle size listed above!  Do what looks and feels right for you, but realize that the size of your scarf may change if you veer too far from worsted weight and size 7 needles.  You may need more yarn!

I was very pleased to be able to knit an entire scarf out of one 4oz skein of handspun.  Sometimes that single skein of beautifully handspun yarn is hard to work with simply because not many patterns call for just one skein.  Plus, a scarf is something you can wear day after day and really have the opportunity to enjoy to its fullest.

The sample is knit with fingering weight yarn, but you can knit this pattern with almost any yarn at any gauge. The pattern includes both specific instructions for the fingering weight version, and general instructions for all other versions.

Use any smooth yarn that will show the lace edging. Do not use anything too fluffy or bumpy, as that will obscure the pattern. The amount of yarn you will need will vary, depending on the weight of the yarn and the needle size used, and how long and wide you would like your finished scarf to be. You will probably want at least 300 – 400 yards for sportweight and dk weight yarn and 200 – 300 yards for worsted and bulky weight yarn.

Use a needle a couple of sizes larger than recommended for your yarn to achieve a nice open lace edging.

Scarves and wraps often serve as ideal blank canvases for the exploration of captivating stitch patterns. Afton was born out of a desire to bedeck a simple, wearable shape with the intricate allover patterning of delicately textured lace and cable motifs. Designed with thoughtful details (a Tubular Cast On, broken rib hems, and flat cord selvedges) and written with instructions for working three widths with Peerie, Loft held double, or Shelter, Afton is one to take on for the pure enjoyment of creating beautiful fabrics to wrap up in.

**Construction**
* This scarf/wrap is worked in two pieces, each from the cast-on edge to the center. The pieces are then joined using Kitchener Stitch.
* The two-piece construction allows for each half to be mirrored over the center line; scarf/wrap is perfectly symmetrical when worn.
* This pattern is written for three weights of yarn, and for a range of different sizes in each yarn.

NOTE: A characteristic of the I-cord cast-on is the appearance of elongated stitches across the first row following the cast-on, which will become much less noticeable after a few rows of the stitch pattern are worked.

Due to its chainette structure, Maai relaxes after washing. For this reason, swatches must be washed and blocked to accurately measure gauge.

The provisional cast-on is then picked up and the second end is worked, as for the first end, so that the two ends are symmetrical.

This pattern includes full written and charted instructions.

I first met Teresa online as a member of my very first Pins & Lace Club. She is a screaming fast (and avid) knitter who soon became a test knitter for me. And a friend. Even though we have not yet met in real life, I know that when we do, we’ll stay up until the wee hours solving the problems of the universe.

Teresa’s scarf is perfect for her yearly vacation. She loves to knit a little something silky, and in years past, she’s knitted scarves to take.

This scarf is constructed with a provisional cast-on, and then one end is knit to the end and bound off. Next, the other end is picked up from the cast-on and worked in the same way, making the scarf symmetrical.
Knitting needles are used for the “crochet” chain bind-off.

-------------------
Welcome to year four of my subscription series (now complete)! The idea for my first ebook subscription ([year one: the pleiades][2]) was born in 2010 while reading posts on Ravelry: people knitting 10 shawls in 2010. I decided to design and knit 10 shawls that year, and at the time I released my first subscription, I had 7 left to do. I reached my goal that year, and the next year I was back for more challenge. After that, I realized that I simply love doing these subscriptions. I won’t even pretend that there’s any other reason to do them! 7 is one of my favorite numbers, and so I am still doing 7 small (and not so small) shawls with 3 (my other favorite number!) accessories thrown in.

When we reached 5,000 people this year, we had a little contest in my [Ravelry forum][3], and so the Year 4 shawls are named after 7 winners, and the accessories are named after...well, you’ll see! I am so looking forward to getting to know the winners a little bit more and coming up with the perfect design for each of them!

The patterns for this eBook will be delivered to subscribers within a subscription period ending March 30, 2015. There is no specific delivery time for each pattern. Patterns will have charts and written instructions, and you will be able to make them out of one skein of sock yarn or an amount of sock yarn comparable to that needed for a pair of socks. Some will be two colors, and maybe even three! But you won’t need more than one skein of any color. There will be a few little extras sprinkled throughout and all patterns will be available to purchase separately!

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

This pattern is free for a limited time. Just add to cart and complete checkout to receive the download. For more info, click [here][2].

This pattern is designed for use with 1 skein of our limited edition gradient sock blank colorway: Sail Into The Sunset. If unavailable when you click over, one skein of any [fingering weight yarn][3] will do the trick. 

WHAT MAKES THIS SCARF SO COOL:
•Looks gorgeous with gradient, solid or variegated yarn. The pattern is simple to allow the yarn colorway to do all the magic.

•Easy 2-row repeat ideal for advanced beginners and beyond. You'll need to know how to knit, k2tog (knit two together), purl, ssk (slip slip knit) and yarn over. 

•You don't have to worry about running out of yarn. Just stop when you're ready to be finished, bind off and voila. Done.

•Size can be adjusted. Want a shawl? Just cast on more stitches and knit until it's the length you want! Want to use thicker yarn and larger needles? Go for it. Very adjustable and I describe how to do so in the pattern. 

•Gauge isn't important. Yay! It doesn't matter if you ""get gauge"" on this one. It's a scarf so if it's a wee bit smaller or bigger than the sample shown, it's all good. It'll be your unique work of art.

711047,Snowberry,Amy Christoffers,2.3,8.0,4.0,Stockinette Stitch,300.0,"“I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, ""Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” –Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass

The short days of winter are an excuse to bundle up in cozy layers. The Snowberry scarf is a satisfyingly quick project that will adapt to almost any yarn, and almost any gauge.

You cast on and knit until you’re done (or run out of yarn). It is also a good introduction to working with Brioche stitch. You begin with only a few stitches, but working regular Kf&b increases as you go, it quickly grows into a lofty textural rib, accented with snowball-like pompoms that will keep you as warm and cozy as a quilt when the snow falls.

It is a pretty fast project that has just enough complexity to keep the knitting both interesting and easy to memorize. Repeats of the pattern allow to adjust it depending on the desired length and width of a finished scarf. Any dk/sport weight yarn can be used, as gauge is not crucial.

This scarf makes the brioche a little more interesting to knit by working it diagonally.

-Always knit the last stitch on every right-side row through the back loop, so the slipped selvedge stitch is not twisted.

Cascara was inspired by the Cascara Buckthorn tree of the Pacific Northwest, an area renowned for its lush forests. This wrap features a lovely and easy-to-memorize chevron lace that echoes the tree’s deeply veined leaves.

Knitted in fingering-weight Yummy 2-Ply, Cascara is a long, wide rectangle that showcases a gradient set and one coordinating color. Each of the gradient colors is used to knit one band of lace, so that the colors gently evolve along the length of the wrap. A coordinating color is used for the garter borders at the beginning and end of the piece, as well as the rippling garter ridges between each of the gradient bands.

The finished piece is stunning as either a wrap or a scarf, with softly shifting bands of color and texture that are bound to turn heads!

981496,Smiley Diamonds Stole,Kimberly Michael,3.25,5.0,4.0,,200.0,"Saw someone at my lys ([Wollhaus][1], Woohoo!) wearing a similar wrap and decided it was the perfect thing for the random chunky/bulky yarns in my stash. She couldn't remember the pattern name, so I dug through my stitch pattern books and found a similar motif.

This knits up into a giant triangle with big holes you can use to pull the ends through, which is useful if you're like me and always misplacing shawl pins. Better still, it’s a triangle that doesn’t use that center increase thing that makes a big line down the middle. I hate that. The lace pattern is a simple repeat that you’ll be able to do in your sleep after the first couple of rounds. It benefits from a stern blocking to open up the lace.

I used size 13 needles with 200 yards of fiber. I ended up with 5–7 yards left over. I think this would work pretty well with size 15 needles, but you might need more yarn. I'm a US size L/XL, I can wrap it around my shoulders and have enough width to go around me and pull a tail through a hole to hold it. To make the project wider, work more 10-row repeats; each repeat adds 8"" of width and 4"" of height. 

This would be good in a heavy fuzzy yarn, chunky yarns, several lighter weigh yarns held together.

Notes From the Designer:

•This pattern was originally designed as a scarf for my husband for a trip that we had planned. We love to travel to new places and experience all that this incredible world has to offer. Some of our fondest memories are from days begun with no plan, when we were free to explore wherever the path took us. Uncovering the unexpected. Wandering.

•The bones of this design are extremely simple. A basic knowledge of knit and purl is all that is required. Any yarn weight may be used, creating virtually any size that you desire. Broad flexibility in the size and shape of the squares also exists. For best results, avoid heavily textured yarns. Lighter colors and/or yarn with a bit of shine will highlight the stitch patten best. So many possibilities exist! Choose your yarn and make it in any way that makes you happy!

###**About the Pattern**###

Inspired by Van Gogh's Starry Night, the colors of the Whirl Scarf swirl and twirl in spirals and eddies. Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on either side. Work the scarf in navy and gold to represent whirling stars on a night sky or choose new colors for the swirls.

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The scarf is approximately 65"" (165.1 cm) in length, but can be increased or decreased in approximate 7"" (17.78 cm) intervals. The scarf is approximately 5.25"" (13.33 cm) wide. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 400-425 yards (366-389 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn.
* Needle to weave in ends.

**Errata**

The initial version of the pattern (v1.0) had a mistake in the cast on count. The correct cast on count should be 84 stitches or 42 pairs of stitches. Version 1.1 has the correction.

Double knitting shows a design in (generally) two colors on one side and an inverse design of those two colors on the opposite side.  It’s a perfect way to make something a little thicker, squishier, and with a unique colorwork element.  After knitting this scarf, you will have a good understanding of double knitting.  

[A free version of this pattern can be viewed on my blog.][1]  

This scarf will measure about 7.5” wide and 72” long.  You may easily adjust the length of the scarf by working the pattern repeat more or less

Tapestry needle to weave in ends

Gauge:  
18 sts and 20 rows = 4” in double knit pattern

This is a beginner + level knitting pattern and is a great intro into double knitting.  You will need to know how to work the Chain Edge cast on method, bind off, knit, and slip stitches.  Expirience working with two colors of yarn is helpful.

You can combine foxes and zigzags in any way you like, as a wrap, scarf, or even a blanket. The scarf as pictured is seamed, because I wanted to have the same foxes on both ends. It is small, about 150cm long and 30 cm wide. I used just one skeing of Uneek Fingering-weight yarn from Urth.

Determined to educate the wizarding world about magical creatures, he travels the world conducting research for his book *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*, sometimes rescuing the creatures he meets along the way. Although he was sentenced to expulsion from Hogwarts as a teenager, he maintains a relationship with Albus Dumbledore, who argued against his punishment, and wears his Hufflepuff scarf with pride.

Two strands of yarn are held together to create an extra squishy, marled scarf. Worked in the round from the bottom up in a tube so there is no exposed wrong side, this scarf is easily adjustable both in width and length. The jogless stripe technique keeps the striping even, and alternating fringe is added to both ends, closing up the tube. Knit it in the original Hufflepuff colors or personalize it with your own house colors!

Gauge:
33 sts and 27 rows over 4”/ 10cm in Stockinette stitch. Note: exact gauge is not critical to this design. Gauge variations may impact final size and yardage requirements.

Special Notes:
Cable It: work sts out of order or use cable needle, if desired.
Customize It: easily customize the length by working fewer or more repeats.
Pair It: working On the Set as part of the large project in the Technicolor: Movie Night Collection? Make sure scarf measures long enough to comfortably wrap around and tie. For larger sizes, you may wish to work a longer length, which may need an additional skein. For smaller sizes, you may wish to work a shorter length.
Slip It: slip as if to knit or slip as if to purl, whatever you find more comfortable. Consistency in slipping style is what is important for a flawless edge.
Watch It: check out mini tutorials for the I-cord Cast On and Bind Off and cabling without a cable needle on the Knit Eco Chic blog, Quick Stitch Tutorials.

**TECHNIQUES**
If you've ever heard about brioche from other knitters, you might be feeling intimidated and as if it's too difficult for you. Or maybe you've tried it before, and the pattern you used made you more confused than when you started. I feel you, because I've been there too! But, I'm convinced that with the right support, you can absolutely knit brioche... and love it.

The techniques used for this brioche scarf include brk, brp, k, and sl1yo. The tutorials for all of these stitches are linked in the pattern, as well as a one color brioche tutorial and a two color brioche worked-flat tutorial! 

*Note: if you are especially wanting to work 2-color brioche and you're feeling a bit scared, you may want to start with 2-color brioche in the round, such as with the [Any Yarn Brioche Cowl][3]*

All of my patterns include clear, step-by-step instructions and linked video technique tutorials that **walk you through the pattern with confidence**. I am also available for pattern support if you have questions.

**From the Test Knitters**

> ""This is an amazing formula pattern. It’s great for those of us with plenty of experience that just don’t want to do the math ourselves. You could even change up the stitch pattern without too much difficulty."" -Elfinfaerie

> ""Aha experience! is what I would say for this project. I am a crocheter turned knitter having knitted only a few projects.Flexibility to use any weight yarn, accomodating different cast on and bind off methods and clearly explained brioche basics with a video support for each one, what more could I have asked for. Loved to work on this project ""

> ""My daughter loves her scarf ...& I loved knitting it for her! Jessica provided clear instructions, as well as alternate finishing options to customize the project based on the knitter's experience level."" - tanya

> ""The way you choose to communicate and explain,  makes you stand tall above the other designers I have pattern tested for. It was wonderful experience for me.""

You'll show them when summer finally began or a long white winter closed in for good. And you'll remember how calm it made you feel to look up and appreciate the sky every day for a full year.

Sky Scarf is the first in a series of creative knitting projects designed by Lea Redmond. Watch the weather for a year and let the sky be your guide!

Read a little more about my project here:

Welcome to my quest! The idea for this ebook was born while reading posts on Ravelry: people knitting 10 shawls in 2010. I kept musing about all of those knitters stretching themselves, and I wondered about challenging myself to design 10 shawls in 2010. I had already designed and knit 3 shawls, and I am becoming addicted to small shawls made of sock yarn. My sock yarn stash is growing. And growing. I decided to jump in! I’m starting late, and I have 7 shawls to go before the end of this year. Can I do it? We shall soon find out!

***Update December 31, 2010: I have attained my goal! Today, I finished and blocked the 7th and last shawl for the eBook. The last three shawls have not been released yet, but will be released to you as soon as my test knitters have finished them! Thank you so much for joining me in the adventure!!***

When you subscribe to this ebook, you will receive periodic notices that there is a new pattern ready. Just go to the link provided and download your next copy of the book. Each update will include the past patterns, as well, so there is no need to keep lots of files. The update file will completely replace any older files.

Each of the shawl patterns will also be sold separately, but when you buy the entire collection as an ebook, you will also get other small patterns sprinkled here and there–at least 3 extras! Those extra projects will not be available for purchase alone. And with an ebook purchase, you'll already be getting at minimum 3 of the shawl patterns free, as well!

Each of the 7 shawls in this book is named after one of the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters of Greek mythology–nymph companions of Artemis–turned into stars to save them from Orion’s pursuit. Follow along with me – I'll be [blogging][1] the progress I make through the design process: imagining, swatching, charting, testing and laying out the patterns while trying to live a normal life!

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

**ABOUT THE PATTERN**
I loved the long red lace scarf Amy Pond wears in season 5 of Dr. Who (“The Vampires of Venice” and “Vincent and the Doctor”). So, I designed something similar ­ long and lacy and flowing. I picked a lovely lace from Barbara Walker’s Treasury of Knitting Patterns, added borders and repeats. This scarf is as fun to knit as it is to wear! **Originally published in 2011. Edited and updated for 2019.  Still free. Happy knitting!**

This type of motif has been used often in weaving but not very much, as far as I have found, in knitting -- probably due to the long floats and/or complex twisting required by Fair Isle and Intarsia techniques. However, double-knitting does away with both of those limitations.

Because this pattern uses an all-over checkerboard chart, it’s hard to tell which side is the back and which is the front at a quick glance. The reason for double-knitting this piece is more so that both sides will be presentable rather than that either side shows a different “mood”.

“The classic cabled scarf is an iconic piece of knitwear with endless variation. It’s a leitmotif that I love playing with and am continuously inspired by. Guilder features a beautiful double-coin cable running up the center, flanked by heavy fishbone cables that mirror each other. Each end features a 2×2 ribbing that flows directly into the motifs without interruption, while the selvedges of the scarf combine a built-in 2-stitch I-cord with a column of 1×1 ribbing to create a clean and flat edge. The stitch patterns are reflected over a center detail so that the directional cable motifs look symmetrical when worn.

The finished piece is a perfect textured accessory for bundling up on hook when not being worn.” – Jared Flood

Notes From the Designer: 

Inspired by my first home: Alaska.

Winters in Alaska can be brutal. Extremely dark and cold and often very isolated and lonely. But when you make it through and the lakes begin to break up, the snow starts to melt, the sun gets higher and higher in the sky each day... Ahhhh. It's a time of transition and hope and excitement for the spring and summer ahead!

This Melting Transitions wrap is designed to mimic that feeling of hope and renewal.

•A gorgeous and easy knitted shawl pattern, based on seed stitches and wedges. This pattern can use virtually any type of yarn, but is especially great for hand-spun or gradient yarns or fade kits.
 
•It's a very enjoyable pattern as you don't need to know exact yardage. You just knit wedges until you're happy or until you run out of yarn. Woo!
 
•You will notice that all the wedges are nearly identical, with only a minor difference for the first and last wedge. You can adjust the width of a wedge by casting on an odd number of sts greater than 19.
 
•[Watch a tutorial of this pattern here][4]! You'll learn to how to get started with the shawl and work up through row 9.

It’s so stretchy, that if you pull it over your head like a turtleneck, it is transformed into a super soft cowl, with lots of interesting depth and texture. This surprisingly fun knit is sure to delight. The design is all about using color to make a statement, so get creative! The pattern includes suggestions for 4 expertly selected colorways as well.

Welcome to year three of my subscription series! The idea for [my first ebook subscription (year one: the pleiades)][3] was born in 2010 while reading posts on Ravelry: people knitting 10 shawls in 2010. I decided to design and knit 10 shawls that year, and at the time I released my first subscription, I had 7 left to do. I made my goal that year, so [the next year I was back for more][4]. Today though, I have realized that I simply love doing these subscriptions so much, I won’t even pretend that there’s any other reason to do them! The number 7 is one of my favorites, and I like including the extra accessories. So here comes year three!

I am still addicted to small shawls using sock yarn and my sock yarn stash is still growing. And growing. It seems to be bigger every day! And I must admit, I love feeding it. This year’s subscription will celebrate the beauty of my new home in northern Nevada, and Jimmy Beans Wool is celebrating with me! Stay tuned for all sorts of good fun from both of us as we take you on a tour through this gorgeous area! 

The patterns for this eBook will be delivered to subscribers within a subscription period ending June 30, 2013. There is no specific delivery time for each pattern, but look for the first pattern in late August of 2012. All patterns will have charts and written instructions, and you will be able to make them out of one skein of sock yarn or an amount of sock yarn comparable to that needed for a pair of socks. Some will be two colors, and one is even three! But you won’t need more than one skein of any color. There will be a few little extras sprinkled throughout and all patterns will be available to purchase separately!

Are you ready? Happy knitting!

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

**Framed** is a sideways knitted kerchief-style shawl in the same spirit as the popular Baktus.

Panels of trellis lace are framed by strips of garter stitch, and the whole scarf is framed in I-cord, making clean, tailored edges. 

**Framed** can be made with any weight yarn and in any size – it is very versatile and it's all up to you!!

**Framed** is fully charted, using four charts that work logically through the pattern.  There are also written instructions for each section.

424523,Ocean Bubble Scarf,Yuki H.S.,1.72,9.0,2.0,Garter st.,450.0,"A perfect pattern for Xmas gift knitting, easy and quick knit!! 

“Ocean Bubble Scarf” is a reversible garter scarf. As the shape is a parallelogram, the slanted edges move like waves.  

It has “bubble,” created by the eyelet rows.  A dotted line alongside the “bubble” expresses the “splash” from the bubbles on the both sides of this reversible scarf. As I like asymmetrical designs, one “bubble” row is off-centered. The 2-color version, which introduces a contrasting color, adds “light” into the ocean. 

**Note**

A plush cabled hat and scarf set provides jaunty warmth for sledding, cross-country skiing, or simply tramping out to the schoolbus. The pert, mushroom-shaped cap is worked up from a tubular cast-on hem in two skeins of Shelter and is sized all the way to adult dimensions; the matching scarf is a simple end-to-end knit that can be worked to any length. Both accessories feature a flight of chevrons filled with garter stitch and flanked by large and small simple cables to timeless and ageless effect.

___________________________________________

The expression “fair winds and following seas” got us thinking a little differently about cables. Our simple 9-stitch braid cable goes with the flow, working twists on alternating sides for complete reversibility.

The scarf features wide columns of stockinette and reverse stockinette, which gain a softly braided texture by alternating the direction of the cable twist. Keeping the design simple and symmetrical means that the rows are easy to follow, whether you're reading the text or following the chart.

Heavy equipment! Bulldozers, diggers and cranes! Dump trucks, tankers and cement mixers! Who isn’t mesmerized by a working construction site? 

This pattern provides charts of six construction vehicles. Line up the ones you like, and “double knit” them into a warm and cuddly, reversible two-layer stockinette scarf that will appeal to the contractor in all of us, young and old! 

This pattern does not purport to teach you to double-knit. A quick description of the process is included, along with references to some resource materials — online and off — available to help you master the process, with specific focus on issues that typically arise as you plan and complete a double-knit project, i.e., casting on, securing edges, and binding off. 

As for materials, you will need two colors of yarn and needles. Worsted or DK weight yarn is recommended, along with needles appropriately sized for your chosen yarn. Sample scarves incorporating all six designs and knit with worsted weight yarns and US7 needles have consumed between 420 and 460 yards total.

Brioche knitting gathers stitches into soft wales, warm and airy and perfect to wrap about your neck. This scarf tips the central panel on the bias between parallel tracks for a distinctive and modern look. Once you’ve established the increases and decreases, Junction is a meditative knit. The pattern contains a scarf with traditional dimensions and a slightly oversized version that makes more visual impact. Brioche fabric won’t reveal its qualities until you’ve knit a few inches — wait to assess the effects and check your gauge.

I have been in love with this magical world ever since reading the first book in college and as my knitting skillz increased so did my desire to enshrine my love for this series in yarn. 

""Always... a scarf of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" follows the adventures of the Boy who Lived from the first page to the last. It is double knitted so the sides mirror each other and both sides are ""finished"". There is no shaping, just knits, purls, casting on and binding off.

This Harry Potter inspired scarf can be knit with either lace weight or fingering weight yarn, depending on how large you want the finished scarf to be. Yarn and needle instructions for both sizes are included.

Lace weight yardage: ~1200 yards
Fingering weight yardage: ~1300 yards

This is my first pattern design. I hope you like it!

Note: this pattern assumes a basic understanding of double knitting.

Then you've tried few patterns with it, but beautiful yarn doesn't want to be lace or cables, it doesn't want to be anything but colorful mess. I think I have a solution... 

**Lakes and Rivers** shawl was designed with difficult yarn in mind. It worked neck-down, mostly in garter stitch with short row sections(no warps) in-between. Size is completely customizable, it can be big shawl or small shawlette. 

*Reversed gauge* - each “lake” repeat measures 3.25” x 0.75” after blocking. Exact gauge is not important for this project, it is given to get an idea how dense knitted fabric has to be. Both yarns in the sample shawl are superwash merino, which grows significantly while wet.

**I’ve been obsessed with the Shetland Lace Bird’s Eye stitch all spring (I call it the Hring Stitch in this pattern, which means Circle in Icelandic) and have wanted to use it in a lacy scarf, but it isn’t the easiest to work… so I made you two options for this scarf! You can work the Hring Stitch and be a bit challenged, or you can go easy on yourself and work the eyelet stitch. It is totally up to you!**

Notes
* Hring Scarf works with pre-strung beads on the bottom border, and place beads in the lace stitch. You can, of course, make it without the beads and it will be beautiful!
* Hring Scarf is worked in two halves from the bottom up and grafted at the center.

###**About the Pattern**

Create a magical fantasy landscape with the **Magic Unicorn Scarf**!  Double knit, this scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on each side.  Magical unicorns decorate the entire length of each side of the scarf.  Use color changing yarn for interesting color combinations or solid yarn for a more classic look.

Full instructions are included for the double knitting technique.  The finished length is approximately 78 inches (198 cm), and can be increased or decreased in 15 inch (38 cm) intervals. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 475-500 yards (434-457 m) each of fingering weight yarn in two contrasting colors for an approximately 78 inch (198 cm) length scarf.  Scarf can be increased or decreased in approximately 15 inch (38 cm) intervals.
* Needle to weave in ends.

788223,Gradual Change,Jane Vanselous,4.83,24.0,4.0,stockinette,640.0,"The diamond shaped lace patterns in this shawl begin as a very open mesh and gradually change to a solid. It may be knit in a single color, but combining it with the color gradations in the Cheshire Cat mini skeins produce a pretty ombré effect.

Directions are for knitting either a scarf or shawl/wrap. Yardage for the shawl is 640 yds fingering weight and 380 yds for the scarf.

All lace patterns include a ""resting"" row - ie., no lace stitches on the wrong side, with the exception of the edge pattern. An alternative edge pattern is provided, if you desire a full ""resting"" row.

The larger needle is used for casting on and binding off. This is optional, but highly recommended in order to give plenty of stretch when blocking the points on the scarf/shawl.

General Lace Knitting notes are included at the end of the pattern. These are meant to help the less experienced lace knitter with ways to recognize the stitch patterns, minimize mistakes and find them earlier when they occur. ",7.0,12,31,5.0,,Fingering

This pattern uses 11 different colored mini skeins of Mountain Colors Twizzlefoot, approximately 70 yards each. Finished size is approximately 13.5"" x 57"" after blocking. For 2018 West Michigan Yarn Quest, each store had a different set of contrasting colors. The pattern download lists the original colors the scarf was designed with. 

The inspiration behind this design came from the coming together of ten West Michigan Yarn Shops for our annual Yarn Quest. We had a custom color of Mountain Colors Yarns “Twizzlefoot” yarn dyed exclusively for our 2018 event. Michigan Cool Waters is the name of this gorgeous yarn and pays homage to Lake Michigan, while the pattern design represents a stretch of US131 as well as the curvy, winding back roads that make up West Michigan…our home. My design also represents the journey of the quest…beginning with the 10 lozenges, representing our ten stores, as your plan of attack. You begin with Michigan Cool Waters, traveling through the pattern and through beautiful West Michigan to our ten different and amazing stores in a random but organized way and finally end up with Michigan Cool Waters to finish off the journey…back home. The ending lozenges trail off slowly as you unpack your treasures and remember all the fun you had at each store. Now you’re ready to knit.",6.0,73,110,4.7,one size,Light Fingering

Knit up with DK-weight yarn, it’s a great layering accessory.

**Pattern Information:**

**Finished Size:** Approx 13”/33 cm x 62”/156.5 cm (after blocking)

**Yarn:** Approx 720 yds of DK-weight yarn, shown in Edna Extra by Dirty Water Dyeworks (85% Polwarth Wool, 15% Silk; 250g = 730 yds), 1 skein.

**Gauge:**
* 22 sts = 4”/10 cm in st pattern before blocking
* 19 sts = 4”/10 cm in st pattern after blocking

Gauge Notes:
* Exact gauge is not critical but will effect finished size and yardage amounts.
* Because scarf is knit lengthwise and is quite long, your stitch gauge will be stretched out quite a bit after blocking. When swatching, focus on matching the “before blocking” gauge, knowing that when scarf is blocked you will stretch it out to match finished measurements.

**Needles & Other Supplies:**
• US 7/4 mm 32”/80 cm or 40”/102 cm circular needle, or size needed to obtain gauge.
• Tapestry needle to weave in ends.
• Optional: removable stitch marker (to mark RS of work).

The wonderfully rich faux cables are made with knits and purls.  You don’t need to know how to cable!  This is a great pattern for new knitters or someone looking for a quick easy knit. 

Yarn: The pink model used 225-230 yards of WoolAddicts Air. The grey model used 235-240 yards of Rowen Cocoon. Choose your favorite bulky yarn.  I recommend something lush and soft with a bit of a halo to give it a rich feel but it will look good with any yarn you prefer.  I've also made this for friends in Cascade's Baby Alpaca Chunky and it looks and feels great.

Needles and needs: 
•	10 (US) needles or 10.5 (US)
•	Two stitch markers
•	Locking stitch marker
•	Tapestry needle

Gauge: 
Pink model (Air) - On size 10 needles in stockinette: 17 stitches by 26 rows over 4” x 4” 

Grey model (Cocoon) - On size 10.5 needles in stockinette: 16 stitches by 22 rows over 4” x 4” 

About the models:
Peachy-pink Scarf: The pink model uses 225-230 yards of Wool Addicts Air in color 0029 on 10 needles. I knit the 20 row pattern a total of 15.5 times.  For me this produced a scarf that is approximately 46.5 inches long.  In this version, the scarf is soft, light and foamy.

Grey Scarf: The grey model uses approximately 235-240 yards of Rowen Cocoon in Scree on 10.5 needles.  To get the length I wanted, I knit the 20 row pattern a total of 14 times.  For me, this produced a scarf that is approximately 47 inches long.  In this version, the rich, heavy fabric drapes nicely.

You can easily make this scarf longer by adding additional 10 row pattern repeats.

964660,Infinite Blossoms,Stephanie Shiman,1.33,24.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,420.0,"Inspired by our ""Infinite Stripes"" pattern, we wondered what would two color-morphing cakes of ""Blossoms"" do if worked together from opposing ends.  So, we took two cakes of the same colorway and knit stripes--two rows from one end of one cake, and two rows from the opposite end/color of the other cake.  The result was lovely!  With a dramatically morphing cake--such as shown in ""Zinnia""--even the center-most colors (which are very close to the same) are discernible.  With a gradient cake--such as shown in ""Globe Thistle"" the shifts are very subtle and the center-most colors met and merged in the middle.  

The pattern has the option for two sizes--a 10""/25cm wide version that will wrap three times around the neck, and a 12""/30cm wide version that wraps twice.  

Started from a provisional cast-on and finished with a three-needle bind off, watch the colors interact as you go.  

Alternately, you could use 2 different colorway cakes--and if you do, share photos!!!

The best part of scrappy, mini skein projects is their nature of holding memories in each piece. The Scrapbook Scarf pattern knits mini skeins together to create a cozy and wearable memento. It is designed as a Mystery Knit Along (MKAL) over the 12 Days of Christmas, knitting a 20g mini each day starting on December 25, and resulting in a scrappy scarf that holds the memories of the holidays in each day. This pattern uses garter stitch and join- as-you-go methods that are easy to remember and intuitive. A pictorial for the join-as- you-go method and schematics for each step are included. Best of all, the pattern repeats after the first few days, so you can make your scarf shorter or longer as you please. Instructions are included on how to either seam into an infinity scarf, or create a classic scarf shape. I am so excited for us to scrapbook our memories together into this knitted piece through the holidays!

**Yarn:**
A total of approximately 900 - 1000 yards of Fingering/ Sock weight yarn in more than one color.
Designed to use 12 (13 if doing a classic
scarf) different mini skeins in 20
grams/92 yards each.
*See Notes Section for color suggestions

**Suggested Yarn:**
1 Set of Bumblebee Acres Farm's Squishy Sock 12 Days of Christmas Calendar was intended to be used in this pattern.

**Needles & Notions:**
One sets of US 5 Needles
1 Optional Progress Keeper
1 Crochet hook or darning needle to weave in ends and seam if doing the infinity scarf version
Optional Row Counter

**Finished Size:**
Finished Measurements blocked are approximately 78"" wingspan and 14"" wide.

**Notes on Color**
This scarf is designed to show off 12 of 13 different colored mini skeins, but you can knit it in any yarn combinations of approximately 1000 yards!

Color Ideas:
* 2 or more alternating larger skeins. 
* 1 full skein and 6 minis alternating
  larger skeins with mini skeins
  scattered in.

If using only two colors, or 1 full skein and minis plot them in each day as follows:
Color 1 or minis on Days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, (13 if doing the classic scarf shape)
Color 2 on Days: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
Whatever you choose, the resulting project will be colorful and cute!

**Notes on Construction**
* You will need to know how to pick up
  and knit along the edge, in garter
  ridges. There will be a picture

1218787,The Great Migration,Janet Avila,0.0,18.0,4.0,stockinette after blocking,490.0,"This pattern was designed for the first stop of the Winter 2022 Good Vibes Yarn Tour. The pattern will be available to the public in November 2022.

For more information about [the Good Vibes Tour][1], [sign up for our newsletter][2].

The sample was knit with two contrasting skeins of Sister Ananse Zebra DK. These colors (Bronzeville and Cooler by the Lake) were dyed exclusively for the Good Vibes Yarn Tour. I look forward to seeing what other combinations you come up with.

This design is inspired by the Bronzeville neighborhood, the center of African-American history on Chicago’s South Side. Also known as the Black Metropolis, Bronzeville is one of the most important destinations of the Great Migration and home to Ida B. Wells, Gwendolyn Brooks, Louis Armstrong, Quincy Jones, Muddy Waters, and more. 

As you travel through your knitting pattern, I hope you will take time to learn more about the Black history that might be new to you.

Enjoy!

Both projects are worked flat in soothing garter stitch, in one or as many colors as you like. The cowl is seamed to form a continuous loop—ideal for wrapping twice for extra warmth or worn open when you need to cool down. The scarf has been cleverly designed to make its own fringe as you knit, meaning there are no ends to weave in. Knitters of all skill levels will enjoy knitting these designs, as instructions are provided to let you knit either project at any gauge. We love to knit it especially with our all-American wool Lark, a soft and ultra-cozy worsted weight yarn.

The Afterglow Scarf is part of Warmth: A Knitwear Collection by Woolmade and Jojô Tricot, designed by Adella Dutra and Paula Leme. All patterns from this collection use the luxurious Cashmere Merino Bloom by Purl Soho.

The Afterglow Scarf is a two-tone striped garter scarf. The color choices were a way to represent the beautiful sunset sky going from a deep blue to red hues and finally the darkness of night. The color scheme is worked with a constant main color and three contrasting alternate colors. This garter one-row stripe pattern is achieved by alternating knit and purl rows throughout. Although this is a simple scarf, the switching between colors and knit and purl rows makes this a fun project.

I had the amazing opportunity to visit the Fairy Glen on an exceptionally rainy fall day. Wandering among the cluster of hills I was stunned by the beauty of the rock formations, the cone-shaped hills that are dotted with ponds and waterfalls. It's otherworldly, a place you'd expect to find mythical creatures.

While I didn't find any mythical creatures, I did find inspiration for this shawl pattern--the rows of garter stitch lace for the uniquely textured landscape, and the lace reminiscent of the pools of rain water.

This shawl is a smaller crescent shaped shawl knit in a simple, easy to remember garter stitch lace with drop stitches and increases on both the right and wrong side. Once the lace repeats are completed you'll knit a garter stitch lace applied border that creates the binds off.

""Five simple scarf patterns for beginners, arranged starting with the easiest, each scarf adding one new technique or twist.

The patterns are all written for worsted weight yarn, so beginners can use the leftovers from the beginner's hat to start. But since size isn't a real issue when you're dealing with scarves, feel free to try a different yarn with a similar gauge. Or for a quick knit, try some bulky yarn and follow the numbers in italics.

The adventurous beginner can also try changing colors by dropping the old yarn at the end of a row and starting the new row with a different colored yarn. When weaving in ends, twist the two colors around each other once to close any hole that might have formed when changing colors and weave ends into their respective color areas.""

CO 258 stitches (or any number you want that is  a multiple of 4 plus 2) on 32 inch circular needle. I suggest the crocheted cast on, but any will do. Join in the round, being very careful not to twist yarn. Place a marker at the beginning of the round. Start knitting the pattern and complete to the marker. You should be able to just continue with the same pattern beyond the marker. It will self-correct, so that you are purling the knits and knitting the purls.

***“Once upon a leaf”***  is an airy lace stole/wrap with beautiful winding leaves stitch pattern. Leaves evoke feelings of spring and summer, but this stole would make a great accessory for any time of the year. The stole is seamless and knitted from the provisional cast on to the edge in both directions.  The edges are finished by picot bind off. 

Finished Size: 
The sample stole in the photographs after blocking was 54cm (21 inches) wide and 164cm (64 inches) long. You can easily make it bigger or smaller by adding or taking away pattern repeats. The stole design is modular and border pattern can be started after desired number of the body pattern repeats is knitted.

Gauge:
The gauge is not critical in knitting this shawl. Adjust your needle size to suit your yarn and achieve the size and the look of the shawl of your choice.

Welcome to year three of my subscription series! The idea for [my first ebook subscription (year one: the pleiades)][3] was born in 2010 while reading posts on Ravelry: people knitting 10 shawls in 2010. I decided to design and knit 10 shawls that year, and at the time I released my first subscription, I had 7 left to do. I made my goal that year, so [the next year I was back for more][4]. Today though, I have realized that I simply love doing these subscriptions so much, I won’t even pretend that there’s any other reason to do them! The number 7 is one of my favorites, and I like including the extra accessories. So here comes year three!

I am still addicted to small shawls using sock yarn and my sock yarn stash is still growing. And growing. It seems to be bigger every day! And I must admit, I love feeding it. This year’s subscription will celebrate the beauty of my new home in northern Nevada, and Jimmy Beans Wool is celebrating with me! Stay tuned for all sorts of good fun from both of us as we take you on a tour through this gorgeous area! 

The patterns for this eBook will be delivered to subscribers within a subscription period ending June 30, 2013. There is no specific delivery time for each pattern, but look for the first pattern in late August of 2012. All patterns will have charts and written instructions, and you will be able to make them out of one skein of sock yarn or an amount of sock yarn comparable to that needed for a pair of socks. Some will be two colors, and one is even three! But you won’t need more than one skein of any color. There will be a few little extras sprinkled throughout and all patterns will be available to purchase separately!

Are you ready? Happy knitting!

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

Self striping, hand dyed and tonal yarns look fabulous in this design. The pattern is created by alternating stockinette and reverse stockinette sections in small bands. It is recommended that you mark the middle of your yarn before beginning either by measuring the yarn as you wind it or by weighing the yarn before and during knitting. 

An eyelet variation is included in this pattern and is pictured in yellow. **Please note, the eyelet variation should say: c/o 3 stitches to begin.**

Size is dependent on yardage. 

This pattern is based on the original Baktus Scarf created by Strikkelise.

*""MAKE NEW FRIENDS, BUT KEEP THE OLD*
*SOME ARE SILVER AND THE OTHER GOLD!""
~Author Unknown~*

There's an old Girl Scout campfire song that begins with, ""Make new friends but keep the old; one is silver and the other gold.""

While designing *""Fringe with Benefits""*, I became reflective of friends I've known over the years. Each 'fringe' could be a 'friend' in your  past or present,  and for those you've yet to meet. 
The stitches used are some of my favorites. I hope they become yours too, if they aren't already.

Some may say there is no rhyme or reason for the style and design. That's the point. It's the way lives intertwine and mingle. When we try to establish our path, it can suddenly change direction.

So...pick up your needles and fiber; enjoy the direction these stitches may lead you through and enjoy making ***""FRINGE with BENEFITS""***, as you create your own fabric of life.

Techniques: Picot cast on (explained), grafting, lace (lace stitches worked on right side of fabric only).

Pattern includes: Written instructions, glossary, stitch pattern in both written and charted formats, link to photo-tutorial for grafting in garter stitch.

The picot cast-on section of this pattern has been revised to make it easier to understand, and my [new photo-tutorial on picot cast on][2] is now linked in the Resources section.

If you're still struggling with the picot cast on, don't sweat it. The picots are meant to be assymetrical and should be off center with the leaf stitch pattern. So if you're off a stitch here or there, it doesn't matter at all as long as you have the correct number of stitches at the end of the cast-on row.

Using Independence by Spincycle Yarns you achieve lovely color transitions which, in addition to the Breeze brioche motif, create movement and depth to the soft and sexy brioche fabric that gives delightful loft and warmth.    Increases and Decreases form the Breeze brioche motif and the length is customizable for a scarf option. 

**Size**: The size is customizable by adding repeats of the Breeze Motif to the width, or just continuing to knit for a longer scarf (you would need an additional skein of each color for this).

**Finished Measurements**:  Cowl - 30.5"" long by 9.5 inches wide, 78cm x 24 cm.

**Yarn & Additional Supplies** Two skeins of different colorways Spincycle Independence Yarn and one packet two Jül Oval Latches for the closure.  For a totally different mood to your cowl try using Hedgehog Fibres Chunky for a fun rainbow effect; your needle size and gauge will be a little different, so swatch it!   

**Yardage**: 400 Yards Total (200 per skein).  I had some left, so you have enough for slight gauge difference, but plan that you will need it all, just in case.

**Gauge**:  In Pattern 23 stitches x 20 rows = 4"" (10cm) Check your gauge.

**Needles**: 24"" size 7 circular needle.  I knit with Addi-Clicks circulars.  Since I knit loosely, I used size 6 tips with a 24"" cord.

**Notions**: 3 Stitch Markers, Tapestry Needle

Salish Sighs pictured here is made with Fallen Leaves and Frosty Nights colorways of Independence from Spincycle Yarn.  For more information on brioche stitch, I recommend Nancy Marchant’s beautiful resource book, Knitting Fresh Brioche.

803756,Arisaid Pleated Scarf,Laura Cunitz,2.88,22.0,4.0,Stockinette,550.0,"Here’s a project that’s easy to knit and lots of fun. 
You’ll be amazed at how this fully reversible scarf actually pleats - no folding or overlapping stitches at all. And wait to you see what happens when you twist it. It’s fantastic. You can read more about it and see lots of photos in the blog post. 

http://blog.knittingnuances.com/2018/01/16/these-playful-pleats-dont-require-folding

**Technique**
The design is based on the Showy Decrease, a simple modification your standard decrease, k2tog in this case, that results in a raised decorative line. This is especially apparent when knit with garter stitch. There is a free Intro to Showy Decrease eBook in my Ravelry store that has pages of tutorials and some easier one-sided projects to try out.  

**Gauges**
The pattern comes with details for 4 samples with a variety of stripe patterns. They are knit with fingering, sport and DK yarns with gauges per 4 inches (10cm) of of 28 sts, 24 and 22 per the yarn label in stockinette. 

**Sizes**
The pattern is completely flexible but the samples are knit around 6-7” wide and in two lengths: a shorter 48” length that wraps around the neck closely and a longer scarf that is about 72” long.

**Yarn**
You'll want a yarn with some memory. A wool, merino or alpaca blend works well. 

**Yardage** 
Varies widely because of the multiple yarn weights and sizes. The pattern includes details for each of the 4 samples. For example, the 48” pink mobius uses 1 ball each of 3 colors in a sport weight 50g ball (Debbie Bliss Baby Cashmerino).

**Guys and Gals**
The scarf works for everyone depending on your yarn and color choices. It would make a great school or team scarf too. For a sports fan scarf I'd choose the 2 team colors with a neutral (white, gray or black). 

**Support**
The pattern includes a tutorial swatch to test the technique.  There's also a tutorial video showing you the pleats in motion and how to get started on the Knitting Nuances You Tube Channel. That link is also in the blog.

So, I chose a stitch pattern that was easy to remember and wouldn’t bore me to death and cast on.

The resulting accessory is a super simple rib and lace scarf cowl; it can be either one. When I was finished with the piece I new I had the perfect buttons to use and lucky me, they were the right size to fit into the lace portion of the piece. What does that mean? NO BUTTON HOLES to make

906591,#278 Monterey Scarf,SweaterBabe,0.0,18.0,4.0,Brioche stitch,760.0,"The Brioche stitch produces a lovely fabric with lots of depth and beautifully defined ribbed lines. It lends itself perfectly to simple increases and decreases that shift the pattern this way and that.

That concept is exactly what then developed into this flowing scarf! It starts with a little bit of one-color Brioche stitch, then the decreases and increases are placed to gently shift the center stitches to the right, then the left. 

Three colors are combined in this scarf for further visual impact. Color transitions are either done with a little bit of two-color brioche or simply done at the same time as the directional ribbing is shifted.

The sample was knit with the Italian cast on and bind off, which perfectly match the look of the knits and purls of the ribbing. Both techniques can be learned with the online links provided in the pattern. If you prefer simpler techniques, the long-tail cast on and regular bind off will work fine too.

Scarf is a generous width and length. Add that to the natural squishiness and thickness of the Brioche stitch, and you'll be knitting a seriously warm and indulgent scarf.

While I was totally flustered, trying to figure out how to get it out of the house unharmed, the cats were DELIGHTED!  Tracking it through the house, they clearly thought, ""This is the BEST toy you've ever gotten us!""  I was so flustered it didn't even occur to me to lock them in another room, but they were also handy because they didn't really want to kill him, but they kept track of him for me while I raced around trying to find something to catch him with.  I went back to my daughters room and found this scene.  The bird, to me, is very clearly explaining to Pumpkin cat ""I am not a bird.  I am not a bird,  I'm really not a bird.""  And, Pumpkin believed him and lost interest and went to nap.  Persuasive bird!

I thought it was the perfect name for this feathery delight - and if an orange cat mistakes you for a bird while you are wearing it, just say - I AM NOT A BIRD!

Thanks for adding I Am Not a Bird to your favorites.

One challenge that I am forever wrestling with is designing lace patterns that your average man can also wear. Lace is typically perceived as feminine, but when combined with bulky yarns and streamlined features, I think I might just have met this challenge.

When I was growing up, raking leaves was a fall family activity and the best part, hands down, was jumping into the leaf piles at the end. My parents would strategically position a huge leaf pile in front of our tree swing, and my sisters and I would sail off the swing into it with happy shrieks.

Into the Leaves celebrates this family fun. It is a garter-stitch scarf or cowl featuring leafy bands of lace. The reverse side of the lace is equally handsome, with waving ribbed lines. The mix of stitches makes for an entertaining knit and a lovely, easy-wear accessory.

The pattern includes instructions for a scarf, a buttoned cowl and an infinity cowl.  Instructions are fully written, with optional charts for the lace and step-by-step Kitchener Stitch instructions for the infinity cowl.

*I wanted to design a shawl that honors women and girls with a particular focus on those who have touched our lives but whose story is tainted, forgotten, or was unfairly ended in a way that makes you want to honor her and rewrite her story.  For those women and girls, we knit this project: In Honor of Her.*   

*You will begin by knitting side-to-side from the cast on to the bind of edge. The generous yardage will result in a large off-center triangle shape with lots of drape and versatility to be styled various ways. The two-color brioche rows are beautifully interrupted with all over zig zag eyelets leading up to an icord bow bind off and a picked-up lace section.  You will work an applied lace border for the final bind off. It will be difficult to be bored with this technique-rich project!* 

*The sample project was created to honor the life of little Elisa Izquierdo who graced the cover of Time Magazine in December of 1995.  At thirteen years old, I read about the unfair circumstances that tainted her story and she has forever stayed in my thoughts and heart.   For Elisa and others like her, I proudly wear my bow.

Construction: Slanted Gansey scarf is worked flat from one end to the other.

Yarn: Any Sunday Knits 3 ply (light sport-weight) yarns including Nirvana (merino cashmere), Eden (merino), Angelic (merino angora) or Brigadoon (merino tweed); 246 yds (225 m) per 50 gm skein: 3 skeins.
Shown in Nirvana French Pink.

Substitute any light sport-weight yarn that works nicely to gauge: 725 yds.

Size: 10"" wide by 80"" long. Note that the width of the scarf measures much less than the width across each row worked due to the fabric's bias.

The scarf's size is easily modified. Make longer or shorter as you wish. And if you wish to modify the width, the pattern instructions provide notes to help you with that.

Techniques: Knit, purl only for the stitch patterns; increases and decreases - kfb, M1-p, k2tog, p2tog - are used only for bias edge and for a couple of transition rows.

Pattern includes: Written instructions, glossary, stitch patterns in both written and charted formats.

*Kostner* is a rectangular shawl knitted mostly in garter stitch starting from one short edge. The applied crochet chains in contrasting colours are added afterwards.

Zebra yarn, also known as marled yarn, is having a huge moment, and it looks like it's going to stay indefinitely! For me, the perfect shawl pattern for skeins like these is one that does some of the work while the yarn does the rest!

Just like almost all hand-dyed yarn, no two sets of pattern-stripes on a Zebra are alike—and fun fact, the name Zebra actually derives from the Latin for ""Wild Horse."" 

Pattern is written, the construction is top-down, size approx. 15"" at widest depth by 90"" long tip-to-tip.

​It's a kitten tinking across piano keys. It's unspun cumulus clouds coaxed into roving. It's just enough sunlight to warm your shoulders, and a sigh of a breeze might set the whole thing adrift.

The biased cables of Cloud Waltz are punctuated with delicate garter stitch, adding textural contrast to the elegance of creamy stockinette. The result is an organic shape with scalloped edges and oodles of texture.

Wear it unblocked for coils of lofty texture, or block it flat for fluttering elegance.

NOTES
The scarf is worked flat, from end to end. A garter stitch edging frames the scarf on all four sides. The intarsia colorwork design is presented in chart form and is re- peated to achieve the scarf’s length.

The vest is worked from the bottom up in pieces, then seamed at the shoulders and side seams. The armhole and neckline stitches are picked up and a small, ribbed edging is applied. The base of the vest has a deeper band of ribbing and falls a couple of inches below one’s natural waist. The body portion of the vest runs in a straight line from hip to chest with no waist shaping. The back neckline is higher than the front neckline and short rows are worked in the shoulder area to achieve a slope that improves the overall drape and fit. A charted intar- sia design is applied to both front and back panels and extends from the hem to the neckline edge. Charts are worked in Stockinette stitch (k on RS, p on WS). When the neckline curve breaks the charted design, continue following the chart for left and right sides independent- ly until they are discontinued at the neckline edge. Choose a size with 4–8” of positive ease.

1288353,Top Gun: Yarn Edition,Tess Campbell,0.0,22.0,4.0,double knitting,1200.0,"This scarf was inspired by the sunset shots in Top Gun: Maverick. The slow color changes in the Sultan Shadow yarn made for a fun project! This is a great option if you are new to double knitting. If you miscount the contrails, no one will even notice :)

Because it is double knit, the scarf is fully reversible with opposite color schemes on each side. See a video about how I double knit [here][1]. 

You will need two colors of light fingering weight yarn and size 2-3 knitting needles. For this scarf I used 3 skeins of Cotton Kings Cotton 8/4 in black, and 1 skein of Cotton Kings Sultan Shadows in #08 colorway. Some of the color changes were quite long, so I just cut the yarn and moved to the next color section when it was time to change. The finished scarf is 7"" wide and 70"" long.

Can you crochet this pattern? Yes! The jets might be slightly skinnier, but they would still be recognizable! Crochet stitches are usually taller than knit stitches, so you might need to shorten the contrails if you want a shorter scarf. The yarn amounts will also be different since a crochet scarf will not be double sided. See a video about how to crochet a knit pattern [here][2].

**Star Hopping** wrap is a fun and easy knit. It is perfect for knitting in front of the TV, long road trips, or drinking wine! The repeats are short, intuitive, and easy to memorize. You only have to work with one color at a time as the slip stitches create a beautiful texture in the fabric.

You can use high-contrast colors, mid-range contrast, and low contrast. Solids with variegated, 2 semi-solids together, gradients, ombres. Do you have a hand-painted yarn, that is “being difficult” and doesn’t want to be anything but a colorful mess? That one can be tamed too! Just pair it with a contrasting solid and you’re good to go! 

**The size of the wrap is easy to adjust** both in width (by casting on more or fewer stitches) and in length (by working more or fewer main body repeats). The pattern is very versatile and **can be worked on a variety of bases, from fingering to DK weight.** 

The wrap is a rectangular shape, knitted sideways on a bias. The main body of the pattern can be worked from the written instructions or the chart.

Knit up the scarf version in a striking color of fingering-weight yarn, as shown. Or knit a mini scarf (image on next page) using leftover yarn as an accent for your tote or handbag, a small scarf, or a hair tie.

While this versatile pattern includes instructions for the mini scarf and scarf, you could easily use the lace for a wider scarf or shawl (or even a gorgeous table runner!) by casting on additional repeats. With the lace charted and written out, it's easy to do.

Choose a fingering-weight yarn that is loosely plied and has a little loft to it, like the merino wool yarns shown here, for the best results on the larger needle size.

The mini scarves make fabulous gifts and are quicker projects allowing you to use up those remnants of gorgeous kettle dyed yarn you may have left over from larger projects. The scarf uses less than one hank of the fingering-weight yarn, making it also a budget-friendly project.

1317306,Cozy Scarf for Beginners,Amanda Rosen,0.0,11.0,4.0,Stockinette,220.0,"Learn how to knit and purl with this cozy, beginner scarf pattern! 

This pattern features alternating sections of garter (knit all stitches) and stockinette (knit the right side, purl the wrong side) stitch patterns.

It's super fun, super fast, and super easy as a starter scarf. 

**YARN**
The suggested yarn is Lion Brand Wool Ease Thick & Quick, which is a super bulky yarn. 

Any super bulky should work just fine, as gauge isn't as important in this pattern - it's more about learning the technique of knitting and purling!

If you choose the suggested yarn, you'll need 2 skeins. This is enough to create the scarf, and have extra yarn for fringe.

**NEEDLES & NOTIONS**
US 13 / 9.0 mm needles. I used circulars, but straight needles will work, too.

If you choose to add fringe, you'll need a size K (6.5 mm) crochet hook, too.

You will need a tapestry needle, small scissors and scrap yarn for the fringe. You may also want to use a row counter. 

**GAUGE**
11 stitches and 10 rows in 4"", using stockinette as the basis for gauge. This is unstretched.

Keep in mind with this being a scarf, gauge isn't super important so don't let that deter from starting if you're a beginner!

**SIZING**
One size fits all in this pattern!

**NOTES**
Construction: this cozy scarf is knit flat, worked in alternating sections of garter and stockinette stitch. 

Once you've reached the suggested length, you'll cast off the stitches and can optionally attach fringe at both ends. 

I LOVE seeing people knit my patterns and make them their own - if you could tag @charminglymodern and #CozyScarf on Instagram or Facebook that would be great!",,5,8,0.0,One size fits all,Super Bulky

Each section of the pattern adds to the previous, and it gradually teaches the basic stitches and some of the most common increases and decreases used in most knitting projects. 

This pattern is much more detailed and verbose than most patterns in order to be helpful to beginners. There are links to video tutorials of each new element in the pattern. You can also repeat any section for additional practice and to make the scarf longer.

1352435,Countercurrent,Jeny Staiman,4.33,20.0,4.0,Stockinette,700.0,"I like to mess around with shapes just to see what happens, and every now and then I stumble into something really cool. While playing with a series of repeating curves, I discovered that if I get the positioning just so, the curves take on a three-dimensional effect. Countercurrent is the second design I have created that explores this theme. (The first one is [Soliton Wave][1].) This particular exploration evokes the feeling of two currents joining together.

The mathematical principles underlying this visual effect are fascinating, beautiful, and completely invisible. One doesn’t have to be a math geek to enjoy this pattern; just settle into the meditative rhythm and follow the flow.

The garments pictured here use single crochet to strand color through the scarf after the knitting is complete. If you don't crochet, please don't freeze up at the word. First, you can skip the chains entirely if you want. Second, no prior experience with crochet is required (I have a demo video on YouTube that shows all you need to know, which you can view [here][2].) Third, there are other ways of color stranding that you could do instead. Lorilee Beltman is a master of color stranding and she uses a completely different method, you can view her demo [here][3].

Shown in colors: Cowl: Illusion (A); Scarf: Spell (B); and Wrap: Howl (C).

*You'll need one skein for the cowl, three skeins for the scarf (plus extra for fringe), and five skeins for the wrap (150 m/164 yds per 100 g/3.5 oz skein).*

The approximate yardage for each accessory is as follows: Shawl - 729 yds/667 m, Long Scarf - 372 yds/340 m, Short Scarf - 248 yds/227 m, Large Cowl - 87 yds/80 m, Small Cowl/Headband - 73 yds/67 m.

NEEDLE:

SKILL LEVEL: 

Intermediate: This pattern is for those who feel comfortable with knitting and have made a few projects, using various skills and techniques. Skills and concepts include knitting cables from a chart, working a provisional cast on using the crochet chain method, working a three-needle bind off (for cowl), and placing fringe (for scarf and wrap)..

Notes From the Designer:

One of my favorite book series is the *Horatio Hornblower* series by C.S. Forester. It details the adventures of the title character, as he distinguishes himself in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. He was stationed in the Mediterranean Sea for several of his voyages, and in the books, there are many mentions of the various winds and weather patterns that he often encountered. One of the winds was named the “Levanter,"" and it brought cloudy, foggy, rainy weather in winter to the area around the Straits of Gibraltar, between the tip of Spain and North Africa.

I imagine that a soft, snuggly cowl or scarf would have been very appreciated in weather like that! The *Levanter* pattern incorporates a lovely ribbed cable pattern that can be made into a cowl, scarf, or wrap using super soft, bulky yarn. The cable stitch is adapted from *Knitted Cable Sourcebook* by Norah Gaughan. I hope you enjoy these accessories, and they keep you warm wherever life takes you. Happy knitting!

* The approximate yardage for each accessory is as follows: Shawl - 729 yds/667 m, Long Scarf - 372 yds/340 m, Short Scarf - 248 yds/227 m, Large Cowl - 87 yds/80 m, Small Cowl/Headband - 73 yds/67 m.
* These accessories are knitted flat and are easily customizable. You can work extra repeats to lengthen the scarf/wrap, or give the cowl more drape. Just be sure to have enough yarn to compensate.
* If you'd like your cowl to be wider and ""squishier"" without doing a lot of math, you could hold the yarn double, and use a larger needle to accommodate the bigger stitches..
* Written instructions are included on pages 9-10.

*""A unique cable pattern brings eye-catching texture to your accessory collection! The oversized honeycomb fabric of this scarf is interwoven with columns of textural tuck stitches throughout for a rhythmic, undulating pattern that reminds me of wind patterns over desert sands or basaltic columns on a seaside cliff.

The stitch pattern is simpler to work than it appears, employing cable crosses only once every 14 rows; the remaining 2-row repeat is worked for all other rows. The scarf begins and ends with a ribbed edging worked on a smaller needle; the cabled textures flow unbroken from the ribbing, and a corded selvedge is worked along either edge of the scarf throughout for a polished, professional finish. Even the WS of the fabric has a unique patterned appearance that makes this scarf feel special regardless of which side is facing out. Worked in a springy DK- weight yarn, the fabric has deep texture and amazing squish, perfect for snuggling up in when venturing outdoors to meet the elements.""* — designer, Jared Flood

Experiment with a few sizes and choose whichever you feel looks best!

**Note:** If you choose lace weight, you will be holding two strands at once while knitting (If using one skein of lace weight, make sure to have the ball wound so that both the center end and the outside end can be used simultaneously. Most yarn shops have a ball winder that will accomplish this for you).

Lacy loops at the edges are created as you go with a yarn-over at the beginning of each row. But the real secret to the beauty of this piece is in the finishing. Slip blocking wires through each edge loop and steam press gently—transformation!

Instead of pre-stringing the beads, we’ve chosen to add them as you knit with a tiny crochet hook. With this method, beads sit securely around both strands of your stitch and show equally on both sides of your fabric.

Another advantage of this method is that you can change your mind about how many beads to place as you go along. Once you’ve mastered this technique, you can easily add beads to any project.

We love this scarf knit in the subtle variegated colors of [Alchemy Haiku][1], but it also looks lovely in solid colors of mohair lace yarn (like [Rowan Kidsilk Haze][2]).

160632,Objects in Space,L Abinante,1.39,20.0,4.0,stockinette,900.0,"Even though I would consider myself a fairly advanced knitter, I love nothing more than a simple garter stitch project with endlessly stunning results. That’s where Objects in Space comes in. Use one or two skeins of a luxury blend in almost any weight and you can produce a delicious scarf (or shawl) that drapes across your shoulders and neck in a lovely way. From lace to aran weight, I have given suggested needle sizes and cast on numbers for your desired finished size.

If you are the type of person who gets close to the prescribed gauge for your yarn’s suggested needle size, I would not worry too much about your gauge. If you want, you can swatch and block, but it’s really not necessary for a project like this. The beauty of this type of construction is that you can take an 80″ scarf with you everywhere you go, and it lives on a small circular needle, only taking up a small amount of space.

This project relies on two things to achieve it’s gorgeous drape and gauge:

* A much larger needle than you would normally use for that yarn weight
* Intense blocking

This scarf is knit lengthwise. Meaning: the number of stitches you cast on will result in your end length, while the number of rows you knit will result in project’s width. Fairly simple, but potentially confusing.

The fringe is formed by dropping stitches on your final row. To get a nice, clean edge, you should border your fringe with a twisted stitch. This is included in the instructions. While this construction is not unique in any means, the formulas provided may assist you in using up some of that gorgeous stash yarn I know you have tucked away.

The yardage amounts provided in the pattern will give you a small shawl – which is why I have classified this as a scarf. You can make it any size, these numbers serve as a guideline.

I’ve named the formula/pattern after the series finale of Firefly, one of the greatest television shows of all time. The original color I used for my Objects in Space scarf was an unknown Malabrigo colorway, which I thought added to the mysterious nature of the final episode of Firefly. That, and it looked rather space-y to me.

So go rummage through your stash and find some luxury yarn or a gorgeous colorway that you’ve always wanted to knit with and have at it.

The pattern includes both written instructions and charted instructions. Instructions are given to use every single last yard of your yarn. You have two options for knitting the pattern, one of which requires grafting (the other doesn’t).

Options for customization include:

- Custom sizing formula
- Working the entire body in lace (two lace options)
- Preventing edge flaring
- Preventing curling in narrower scarves

Special skill requirements include: provisional cast on, grafting (optional), and lace knitting.

In the lace mohair and silk of the aloft on the large needles, it makes a fluffy lace confection that is almost lighter than air.  You can't tell from the pictures, but the yarn is hot pink.  It basically floats when you handle it.  

For those looking to make a scarf with a lovely pattern in a lighter than air result, this is the perfect pattern.  If you can count to three, the pattern is simple to do, and simply moves the same stitches from one side to another.  The results look far more complex.  They reminded me of the jacaranda flowers on the tree.

This lace shawl is inspired by the urban fantasy novel Wicked Lovely, by Melissa Marr. A novel about a world where fairies and humans intermingle. Aislinn, a teenager, who can see fairies walking among the world and struggles to keep it a secret, in fear of her life. She is approached by Keenan, the Summer King, who employs her help to save the world from his wicked Mother, The Winter Queen. Aislinn must become the Summer Queen to save humanity and fairy alike, or the world will plummet into endless Winter.

Appropriately, our February project is a squooshy piece of heaven to knit in a variety of shapes—scarf, (petite/tall wrap)baby blanket, throw— from mountain-raised merino for lightweight warmth on chilly spring days. Natural yarn colors will enhance the finer details in the cable and lace textures throughout, while richly-dyed colorways will bring their openwork and depth into focus. With all shapes knit in one piece, the repeating motifs are surprisingly easy to work on larger needles, making for a relaxing and satisfying project to snuggle up with on winter evenings.

405544,Nanciann,Dee O'Keefe,2.88,4.5,1.0,Stockinette,800.0,"Nanciann is an elegant rectangular lace stole that is worked in one piece from end to end and may be easily customized to any size you like, be it a smaller scarf size or larger stole. There are only five different stitches in the whole design, so it’s a great first lace pattern that is easy to memorize and relaxing to knit without being boring. Both beginner and experienced lace knitters alike will appreciate the nice rhythm of the twig pattern as it is worked between the two borders.

**Nanciann is offered as both a written and charted pattern with a large, easy-to-read chart that is big enough to read while watching TV and knitting!** 

I conceived of this design as means of teaching newer lace knitters various skills needed to work a perfectly knitted and blocked lace shawl. The instructions include detailed explanations and photo-tutorials for skills such as: 

* How to match the tension of your bind off and cast on
* The math involved with customizing the shawl/scarf size
* How to weigh your yarn to maximize your yardage
* How to work with hand dyed yarn (if you choose one) by showing exactly how to alternate when changing skeins by carrying the yarn up the back
* How to block the stole

Nanciann was designed as the perfect showcase for your favorite hand-dyed yarn. The main stitch pattern—a stylized version of a traditional twig pattern—has a lovely texture that really allows the beauty of the yarn to shine. This center pattern is flanked by a traditional Shetland edging but knitted all in one piece, giving the appearance of a knitted-on border. 

Fingering or sock weight yarn is recommended, but heavier weight yarn may be used as well. 

***This shawl is dedicated to my wonderful friend Nanciann “Nan” Hall, whom I met online while looking for test knitters when I first started designing shawls. Our love of lace knitting formed an instant bond between us. We have chatted back and forth about knitting and life ever since. I count her among my closest friends although we’ve never met. So here’s to my Nan, and to all the online friends we knitters make as we share our passion for fiber***. 

**Construction Notes:** Nanciann is worked in one piece from end to end. There are three sections: a right border edge, a center twig pattern section and a left border edge. The borders are garter based and as such are patterned on the right side only and knitted on the wrong side. The main twig pattern is patterned on the right side only and purled on the wrong side rows.

Cozy enough for working on the water or just for fending off the elements on a blustery day, this generous scarf is plush with panels of trinity stitch and interlacing cables. Tiller is more than six feet of toothsome knitting, worked from one end to the other with a tubular cast-on and bind-off for neat and durable edges. The handsome net of cables is intuitive to knit, so you’ll quickly find a comfortable rhythm. And the trinity stitch yields deep texture in the flanking panels, mimicking the appearance of small bobbles through paired triple increases and decreases that are simple to work. Tiller will also introduce a new edge technique into your repertoire: wrapped chain selvedges have a similar appearance to garter stitch, but yield a cleaner and more structured straight edge that’s useful for all kinds of projects.

A slim scarf with clean, simple lines in an easy to knit pattern that is very enjoyable to work.  Equally at home out in the country or on city streets, this is a hand knit scarf men of all ages appreciate and actually wear.

Guys can be difficult creatures at times … and for a loving knitter, trying to come up with a hand knit gift for a guy that he will actually use can be a challenge. My son is a great example of a guy who a knitter (that’s me) loves dearly but who has very particular taste when it comes to things he will wear.

The first Christmas after I moved to New York from Los Angeles, I wanted to knit a hat and scarf for my son that he could (and would) use when he came to New York to visit at Christmas. I wanted something that would suit his style and taste, while also providing some much-needed warmth for the northern, winter climate. If I knit him something he didn’t want to wear, I wasn’t going to get very far in helping to keep him warm, now was I?

So, I designed this scarf and the matching hat.  The cool thing is, it worked! He loved both the scarf and the hat and has used them every time he comes to New York. He has even found opportunities here and there to use the scarf in particular in Los Angeles in the cold months, whenever they manage to have some of those.",5.0,635,723,4.22,Original and Wide,Aran

The Pattern
-----------

This little triangle can be worn either as a shawl or a kerchief. It tucks in or wraps around, and is just enough to take the winter chill away. In Clara Yarn Cormo 2.0, it’s luxuriously soft, and the beautiful colors remind me of winter in my neighborhood – North Sea, Southampton, New York. 

Skills Needed

Knit, purl, basic lace techniques (YO, increases, decreases). This is a good project for a somewhat adventurous intermediate knitter.

Details

The finished shawl is approximately 46” along the top edge and about 18” deep at the center back.

Knit in one piece from one end to the other, Galahad's stitch pattern is created by an 8-row repeat of knits and purls. Garter stitch creates the grid effect on a stockinette background. A garter selvedge on either side of the scarf frames the grid, and provides a sturdy yet lovely edge.

Galahad is written in two sizes:

**Small:** The small scarf is perfectly sized for folding in half and knotting at the base of the neck. Its finished size is 7"" x 70"", and uses approximately 310 yards of worsted-weight yarn. Small sample is shown in Old World.

**Large:** A bit wider and longer, the large scarf takes well to wrapping around the neck in a more traditional style. Its finished size is 8.75"" x 84"", and uses approximately 490 yards of worsted-weight yarn. Large sample is shown in Soot.


**Additional Gauge Information**

I wanted to make a super long scarf with two sections that met and grew larger in the middle, like a cowl in the middle of a scarf. My friend said ‘What if it went out like this, and then in like this!?’ A couple of sketches later, Retrograde was born. This unisex scarf is knit in a reversible twin rib that looks great on both sides, and the extra long length adds a little drama to your ensemble. Wear this scarf all wrapped up in layers or throw it on and let the ends hang down. Either way, you’re going to be warm and stylish.

Knitting this scarf is truly an act of devotion to Miyazaki. The theme is Princess Mononoke and features all our favorite characters! The pattern uses double-knitting techniques to make a reversible scarf that is extra warm. 

**Yarn:** 875 yards/800 meters of DK weight yarn (238 yards/400 meters of two colors). Chose yarn that contrasts nicely! 

**Techniques:** Double knitting with 2 colors and making tassels (optional). 
If you don’t know how to double-knit and want a little instructions, see the tutorials I’ve made here:

###**About the Pattern**

Fire Dragon Scarf is a double knit, reversible, thick scarf, featuring a dragon on both ends.  The pattern transitions colors halfway through the scarf so that each side is the inverse of the other.

Finished length as written is 55 inches (140 cm), and can be lengthened or shortened following the written instructions.

Contrasting yarns work best for this pattern since they will show off the design more easily.

This pattern includes instructions for the double knitting technique. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 5 US (3.75 mm) needles.
* Approximately 180-200 yards (165-183 m) each of two contrasting colors of worsted yarn for a 55 inch (140 cm) length scarf.  Length can be increased as directed using additional yarn.
* Needle to weave in ends.

The pattern itself is just a single row, knit over and over, to create the chevron shape.  In just a few evenings, you’ll be able to wrap you or a special someone in a bulky scarf hug.

My travel project needs the following criteria: simple to knit but interesting; easy enough to put down/pick up without losing my place but not so easy that I'm overwhelmed by boredom; small enough to fit in my purse but not so small that I'll run out of project before the trip is over.

DFW fits the bill: during a four-hour delay in the Dallas airport, I hit my stride with this garter stripe scarf. Strategic placements of a simple increase and a simple decrease add up to bias knitting with a hint of chevron. The back side is as interesting as the front side, to boot.

The finished scarf measures 8"" wide x 60"" long.

You will need approximately 350 yards each of two colors of fingering weight yarn and US size 4 (3.5mm) needles.

The skills you need are cast on, knit, yarn over, knit 2 together, and bind off. This is a great project for the Advanced Beginner to learn simple stripes and increase/decrease.

The sample is shown in Hawthorne Fingering by KnitPicks, Blackbird Kettle Dye (Color A, dark) and Graffiti Speckle (Color B, light). This would also work well with a gradient or self-striping yarn.

Columns of beaded rib leaven traditional cables for a handsome, unisex accessory with layers of texture. Worked from end to end in Shelter, the Far Hills Scarf can be knit to three different lengths. Because the central horseshoe cable crosses at a slower rate than the flanking cables, the pattern is worked from a large chart. Tubular edges and flat-lying selvedges worked by combining knit and slipped stitches ensure a perfect, professional finish.

This pattern was published as part of Jared Flood’s first print book, WOOLENS. You can purchase all patterns in this collection as an ebook at [brooklyntweed.com][4].

After I discovered the excitement of off-the-grid double-knitting and applied it in my enigmatic Silk Road necktie, I was itching to play more with this concept. I had sketched all kinds of patterns that used modifications of the spirals I had generated previously, but I didn't want to create dozens of different patterns just to show off the possibilities.

Instead, I wrote a bunch of them into a single pattern that changes as it progresses. Integrated into this scarf are off-the-grid diamonds, spirals, Greek keys, and more.

About the series:

***Note knitCompanion set-ups can be purchased ([in the knitCompanion store][2]) for those who like to use knitCompanion, but do not wish to set up their own charts.***

Welcome to year five of my subscription series! The idea for my first eBook subscription ([Year One: The Pleiades][3]) was born in 2010 while reading posts on Ravelry: people knitting 10 shawls in 2010. I decided to design and knit 10 shawls that year, and at the time I released my first subscription, I had 7 left to do. I reached my goal that year, and the next year I was back for more challenge. After that, I realized that I simply love doing these subscriptions. I won’t even pretend that there’s any other reason to do them! 7 is one of my favorite numbers, and so I am still doing 7 small (and not so small) shawls with 3 (my other favorite number!) accessories thrown in.

Lately, I’ve become more than a little obsessed with asymmetry. Asymmetry in color, shape, and stitch pattern...the more I have sketched and dreamed, the more possibilities have come to me. I ended up with a sheaf of designs, and I’m so excited to share them with you!!!

The patterns for this eBook will be delivered to subscribers within a subscription period ending in September, 2016. There is no specific delivery time for each pattern. All patterns will have charts and written instructions, and you will be able to make them out of one skein of sock yarn or an amount of sock yarn comparable to that needed for a pair of socks. Some will be two colors, and maybe even three! But you won’t need more than one skein of any color. There will be a few little extras sprinkled throughout and all patterns will be available to purchase separately!

Are you ready? Happy knitting!

A summary of the story so far and updated character rolling instructions will be included. 
This pattern can be knit in either double knitting or stranded colorwork in the round (or flat, if you prefer), instructions for both are included. No prior experience in tabletop RPGs is required.

If you already have a character from Heroes of Yarnia, you can continue using your character!

**What is a Knitting RPG (KRPG)?** 
A Knitting Role Playing Game! 
The way this works is that I shall act as the Dungeon Master (Game Master) for a custom game of Yarn Quest - Heroes of Yarnia. The welcome letter comes with a couple of extra documents for determining your stats and the stats of your Feline companion. Starting April 28th I will release instructions for determining what charts to knit on your scarf. These charts will be randomized by each person using a set of character stats. There are several dozen charts, so everyone’s scarf will be unique!

Character Sheets 
Included in the welcome letter you will find a set of character sheets and instructions for how to set up your character. Illustrated instructions for how to roll your character will be included in the official Epic Knits MKAL thread on 12-23 (Friday afternoon).

**Special Equipment** 
If you don’t have a set already, I highly recommend getting a set of 7 D20 gaming dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20). They can be found at your local game store (Games by James, etc) or through Amazon - Make sure you pick a set like this one~ (with the 7 different dice, pick whatever colors you like best!). 
If you don’t want to pick up a set of dice, sites like Random.org or random number generators will also work. There’s probably an app out there for dice rolls, because there’s usually apps for everything.

**Prize Drawing** 
At the end of the MKAL there will be a prize thread posted for finished projects. All participants who post a picture of their finished piece will be entered into a prize drawing for a $10 gift card to my Ravelry store. Additional prizes may be added based on number of participants

742784,Escalator Wrap,Theresa Schabes,2.94,22.0,4.0,garter stitch,1400.0,"The Escalator Wrap draws inspiration from the chevrons of a modern quilt design.  Working those stripes from a hand-dyed gradient set gives the illusion of gliding steps - an escalator.  The edges of the stripes are picked out in a bright contrast color for pop and to highlight the color contrast.

Want to make it your own?  Work it all just one main color with a strong contrast color.  Or, use up leftovers and work each stripe in a different.  The pattern provides all the information required for color substitution.

The Escalator wrap is a garter stitch, gradient, chevron striped wrap with I cord edging.

This pattern may look complex, but is built off simple garter stitch units.  For the length of the wrap, you either increase or decrease every 32 stitches, and the color of the stitch marker tells you which to do.  Attention is required at the beginning and end of the chevron stripes to ensure that you get the stripe set up properly, but once that’s done, it’s easy knitting – no purls!

Dive down the double knitting rabbit hole with your choice of three DK techniques (see ""Techniques"" below for more information).

Whichever path you choose, the resulting scarf is smooth and squishy to the touch, making a comfortable, cozy, and lightweight accessory you'll want to wear all winter.

***Yardage***

Main Color: 586 yds 
Contrast Color: 586 yds

*Note: This should cover all three techniques.*

***Sizes*** 

Pictured sample is 7""x71"" (18 cm x 180 cm).

For other sizes, experiment with different sizes of needles/yarn. Gauge is flexible for this project. 

***Techniques***

*Note: There are no tutorials included, but the colorwork charts were designed with the intention of being clear and approachable for knitters of all levels. *

This pattern includes three PDFs, one for each technique described below:

*  *DK only*: the entirety of the design is made using traditional double knitting, causing the colorwork to be mirrored on the WS, including letters and Roman numerals.

* *DK with NMDK (non-mirrored DK)*: Most of the scarf is made using traditional double knitting, with the exception of letters and some Roman numerals. This version will produce a scarf with legible words and numerals on both sides of the work.

* *DK with DS (duplicate stitch):* The entirety of the scarf is made using traditional double knitting, then finished by duplicate stitching over previously knitted stitches. This version will produce a scarf with legible words and Roman numerals on both sides of the work.

*Policy*

A few things to keep in mind:

*Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* by Lewis Carroll and the accompanying illustrations by Sir John Tenniel are both in the public domain, and appropriate credit is given on the cover. 

All other artwork included in the Wonderland Adventure Scarf pattern has been licensed for commercial use without attribution--all artists were compensated fairly for their contributions. ",10.0,60,179,5.0,"One size: 7""x71"" (18 cm x 180 cm) ",Fingering

**Easy Knit and Purl design!** Learn how to make this Easy Color Block Scarf Knitting Pattern. It’s a perfect project for experienced beginners who enjoy knitting flat on straight needles. I love changing textures and colors, which this scarf allows us to do frequently.

Inspired by my new **[Knit Stitch Pattern Book][2]**, this scarf is an easy knit and purl design. Enjoy knitting 5 textured patterns which include Beaded Rib, Double Moss, Tile Squares, Diagonal Zigzag, and Lattice Seed Stitch. Additionally, this scarf is edged in the simple Garter Stitch on every panel!

**Scarf Construction:** The knitted scarf is created from the bottom up on straight needles. To make things even easier, this scarf is knitted in one piece, rather than sewing separate pieces together. 

**Color Changes:** Note that on each color change row, the pattern is Knit Only. This allows there to be No Purl Dash Lines on the right side of your work.

**Finishing Work:** Because we are knitting up our scarf in one piece, you simply need to weave in your yarn ends. I highly recommend lightly blocking your scarf to shape, allowing all of the different stitch patterns into the same dimensions.

I hear some knitters seek sanctuary in a knitting community, away from what is going on out there. I am the opposite. I want to face it and record how I spent day after day at home, and leave something tangible in my memory. 

C19Q. I designed this for my fellow knitters in quarantine. We watch TV, listen to music (Yo-Yo Ma is a good one, very soothing.) and news/podcast about the virus day after day. We think of others who lost their lives and are in the hospitals, and we are deeply grateful for frontline workers. I cannot tell you how much I miss and wish to talk to my late brother, Mino, if he were still somewhere on earth. 

This is a very versatile scarf that you would look forward to wearing once we can go outside, and it is a fun and relaxing knit. There are bobbles (my first try in designing!), yarn overs and knit on wrong side as accents, with the center decrease like a leaf. If you are distracted, skip all that extras. If you are into it, add more. For me, this was the perfect blend. 

We are in this together. Let’s stay safe, everyone. We will be OK.

1052859,Simplified Pyrenees Scarf,Camy Tang,0.0,5.4,1.0,lace pattern,437.0,"This is based off of the antique pattern ""[Pyrenees Knit Scarf][1]"" on pages 36-38 of [The Lady's Assistant for Executing Useful and Fancy Designs in Knitting, Netting, and Crochet Work, volume 1][2], by Jane Gaugain, published in 1840. The original was perhaps 2 feet wide and 7.5 feet long, knitted on US 5 needles, with lace patterning on every row.

I decided to do a simpler version of this scarf, narrower and shorter like a modern scarf. I also thought it might be useful to make this a one-skein project.

This scarf pattern originally had stripes, but Knit Picks Chroma Twist has gradual color changes, which I thought was perfect for this pattern.

I simplified the pattern by making every WS row purled with garter stitch borders rather than lace patterning on every row. The original also had two different versions of a left-slanted decrease, and the difference between them was very minor, so I have combined them so that there is only ssk in the pattern. Since I’m using only one skein of fingering weight yarn, I switched to larger needles and did fewer repeats of the 20-stitch center panel pattern so the scarf would be narrower. 

I renumbered the rows because it was confusing to me to have odd numbered rows be wrong side rows. So now, what is row 1 in the pattern is the set-up row, and row 2 in the pattern is row 1 in my written instructions.

We designed this scarf to track a remarkable, unique season. There are only 60 games this year instead of 162 games. Every two rounds represent the location and result of a game. 

Knit in the round and steeked when the season is over turns this cowl into a scarf with fringe! You don't have to worry about any ends on this one. 

We haven't finished this scarf yet. We knit a few little samples, but we won't know exactly the size until the season is over.

If the idea of steeking freaks you out, you could also leave off the stockinette steek section and just knit this in garter stitch (knit one round, purl one round). It will still be plenty long to wrap twice around your neck as a cowl.


Let's hope for a full 2021 season!

*""Will you walk into my parlor?""* Said the spider to the fly.

Knit yourself a dreamy delicate cobweb of silky alpaca. The ***Widow's Web Scarf*** is created one half at a time, starting from the center with a provisional cast on, and working pattern repeats until achieving desired length.

Choose from the two sizes specified in the pattern, or play around with repeats to find your preferred length:
**small:** 77” long x 20” wide (195.57cm x 50.79cm)
**large:** 102"" long x 20” wide (259.07cm x 50.79cm)

Due to the airy, lacy nature of this piece, gauge is not important; feel free to experiment with yarn weights, and needle sizes.

**Please note that Fyberspates Cumulus is listed as a lace to fingering weight, but is on the heavier side, the thicker core, coupled with the halo, make it almost a sport weight. A suitable alternative would be two strands of lace weight kid silk held double.**

You will need **two skeins** of Cumulus for each given size.

The pattern is made up of different design sections which flow together.  First, choose your yarn-- handspun, dk, worsted, fingering?  Whatever you choose will be lovely!  Make sure to have about 30-50 yards of art yarn on hand for a few of the sections.  This should be of similar or lighter weight than the main yarn, and can be as wild or tame as you like.  No art yarn in your stash?  No problem!  Use a marled, barberpole, or simply a different color.  Or, do you have any of those crazy commercial yarns hanging around in a bin?  Why not hold one or two of those together, to create something new and fun!  You can choose to make your piece in one color, a different color for each section, or a combination of colors that please you.

The pattern instructions are for a rectangular scarf.  Each section has instructions for either 60 or 90 stitches (plus edging stitches), so you find your gauge, and decide how wide you want to knit your piece.

This is a happy little scarf! It has happy little clouds, and happy trees with friends, and some almighty snowcapped mountains- all the basic elements of a classic Bob Ross painting!

Because it is double knit, the scarf is fully reversible with opposite color schemes on each side. If you need help with double knitting, watch my video tutorial [here][2]. 

You will need two colors of light fingering weight yarn (about 435 yards of each color) and size 2 (2.75mm) needles. If you use the cascade heritage, I literally finished with about a yard left of each color. The finished scarf is 5” wide and 60” long.

This timely, triangular scarf will make you look quite dashing during cooler weather or serve as your go-to accessory for a brisk walk.

1298291,Old Chert Scarf,Jessica SF,0.0,20.0,4.0,Old Chert lace,355.0,"One of innumerable variations of the classic Old Shale pattern, this textured lace suggests the ripples seen in ribbon chert rock formations.   When left unblocked, the yarn-overs create  “knuckles” that balance the bumps formed by the P2tog stitches, resulting in an undulating ridge across the fabric.  This lace looks better without hard blocking, so it's great for synthetic yarns.

This beginner-friendly scarf can be made as wide and as long as you want, by adjusting the number of stitches and rows.  Gauge is not important, but swatching is always a good idea to find a needle size that works with your yarn.  

Slipped stitches at the beginning of every row create a smooth chain-like selvedge, and a narrow column of garter stitch controls curling at the edges and sets off the lace pattern.

The fabric wants to fold lengthwise along the columns of yarn-overs, making a tidy narrow section to wrap around your neck.  Note that if you add more repeats to make a wider scarf, the folding may not lie as neatly when worn.  

**Recommended materials**

Yarn:  Soft Baby Steps from Red Heart, or other aran or worsted weight yarn.  Example scarf used 185 grams (307 meters), or 1.3 balls, of this yarn.  Synthetic yarns are fine since you don't really need to block this lace.  

Needles:  5.0 mm (US size 8) needles, plus 2 or 3 sizes smaller for binding off.  Of course, use whatever needle sizes work best for you

Stitch markers, removable, such as coil-less safety pins.  Optional but a great sanity-saver!   

Crochet hook (optional but highly recommended) for casting on using Double Chain CO method.  Size is not important but it should be suitable for your yarn.

Made up of Gandalf, a Wizard; Legolas, an Elf; Gimli, a Dwarf; Boromir and Aragorn, both Men; and Merry, Pippin, Samwise, and Frodo the ring bearer, four Hobbits; it was decided there should be nine members in the Fellowship to match the number of Nazgûl hunting the Ring. An odd brotherhood, each member was chosen to represent their race, despite animosity and distrust between some of the party.

For pockets that hit around the natural waist, knit with Color B until the piece measures approximately the same height as the intended wearer from the cast-on edge. Our Small scarf is 63 inches long and is worn by a 5’2” (62-inch) person.

For pockets that hit at or below the hips, knit with Color B until the piece measures 13-15 inches longer than the height of the intended wearer from cast-on edge. Our Large scarf is 80 inches long and is worn by a 5’7” (67-inch) model.

Read a little more about my project here:
-------

Welcome on my quest! The idea for this ebook was born while reading posts on Ravelry: people knitting 10 shawls in 2010. I kept musing about all of those knitters stretching themselves, and I wondered about challenging myself to design 10 shawls in 2010. I had already designed and knit 3 shawls, and I am becoming addicted to small shawls made of sock yarn. My sock yarn stash is growing. And growing. I decided to jump in! I’m starting late, and I have 7 shawls to go before the end of this year. Can I do it? We shall soon find out!

***Update December 31, 2010: I have attained my goal! Today, I finished and blocked the 7th and last shawl for the eBook. The last three shawls have not been released yet, but will be released to you as soon as my test knitters have finished them! Thank you so much for joining me in the adventure!!***

When you subscribe to this ebook, you will receive periodic notices that there is a new pattern ready. Just go to the link provided and download your next copy of the book. Each update will include the past patterns, as well, so there is no need to keep lots of files. The update file will completely replace any older files.

Each of the shawl patterns will also be sold separately, but when you buy the entire collection as an ebook, you will also get other small patterns sprinkled here and there–at least 3 extras! Those extra projects will not be available for purchase alone. And with an ebook purchase, you'll already be getting at minimum 3 of the shawl patterns free, as well!

Each of the 7 shawls in this book is named after one of the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters of Greek mythology–nymph companions of Artemis–turned into stars to save them from Orion’s pursuit. Follow along with me – I'll be [blogging][2] the progress I make through the design process: imagining, swatching, charting, testing and laying out the patterns while trying to live a normal life!

Merope can be knit as either a stockinette or garter stitch shawl with stockinette panel. Small and medium sizes are included, but the shawl can be enlarged as much as you wish by adding repeats of the second chart.

The blocked dimensions for the smaller stockinette version are 63 x 29 inches, and for the medium garter stitch version are 67 x 31 inches. Please note that I knit lace at a fairly loose gauge and I also block lace very vigorously. Depending on the fiber you use, you may experience varying degrees of bounce-back.

The shawl is knit from the bottom tip up to the top, and bound off along the top edge. There are increases on every right side row. To make up for fewer increases than a traditional triangular shawl, the top portion includes short rows to even out the triangle on the sides and top.

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

When I saw Rowan's Revive, a recycled blend of silk, cotton, & viscose, I was immediately struck by how much it looked like rock.The recycling does the same thing that geological forces do: merges many colors into one mottled color.

I began to get ideas (always a dangerous proposition). I wanted a little throw away scarf to toss on over my summer tanks and under my jean jacket - something vaguely organic looking.

After a little experimentation, I came up with a nifty little reversible pattern that you can whip up in a weekend or so.Only two balls yields a 60 inch long drape of stony goodness. Just right for a gift or a quick & easy vacation project. Adding another half ball will get you 75 inches.

278282,Willamette,Star Athena,3.62,,,,,"The Willamette river is a vital, multi-functioning tributary of the Columbia, rich with life, commerce, and recreation. It runs like an artery up the middle of Portland, crossed often by distinctive bridges and the occasional beaver. The linen stitch and herringbone stitch in the Willamette scarf mimic the ripples, waves and stones of the water.

**Scarf Size**: Adjustable. Sample is 80” long. 6” deep at widest part

**Notions**: Tapestry needle. 

**Gauge**: Gauge is not critical.

**Skill level**: This advanced-beginner pattern is knit flat using some unusual stitches. You’ll need to know how to cast on, knit, purl, slip stitches, increase, decrease, bind off and follow written instructions.

Over time, she became the muse of tragedy - particularly tragic theater - and today is often portrayed with a tragic mask in her hand: the opposite of her sister, Thalia, the muse of comedy. Among the ancient Greeks and Romans, and even in the day of Shakespeare, a tragic play was one with a sad or thought-provoking ending, a comedy would have a happy ending. The ancients asked Melpomene to inspire them in the creation of beautiful and lyric poetry and phrasing.

Melpomene the shawl is knit side to side, and her calming textures soothe frayed nerves in times of stress. The repeating charts have the interest and the simplicity to enhance the healing nature of knitting. Melpomene is a perfect meditation for both the mindful knitter and the knitter in search of solace.

**************

Welcome to year two! The idea for [my first ebook subscription (year one: the pleiades)][1] was born in 2010 while reading posts on Ravelry:  people  knitting  10  shawls  in  2010. This year, they are doing 11 in 2011, so I really must join in the fun!

I am still addicted to small shawls using sock yarn and my sock yarn stash is still growing. And growing. It seems to be be bigger every day! So I’m jumping in again!

This time, because of life happening, the deadline of designing and knitting all of the 7 shawls for this subscription in 2011 is, I'm afraid, not possible. (Though I am still on track to design and knit 11 shawls in 2011!!) But the patterns for this eBook subscription will be delivered to subscribers within the subscription period of a year: ending June 30, 2012. As this is a challenge to myself to design, knit and release 7 shawls in the period of a year, I did not set a specific delivery time for each pattern.

All patterns will have charts and written instructions, and you will be able to make them out of one skein of sock yarn or an amount of sock yarn comparable to that needed for a pair of socks. There will be a few little extras sprinkled throughout and all patterns will be available to purchase separately.
The Muses will be the theme for year two. Yes, there are 9 muses, not 7! This means that not every muse will have a shawl. But each muse will have a pattern in the book.

Are you ready? Happy knitting!

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

The garter stitch adds texture and depth, keeping the scarf from rolling up. The stitch pattern is modified from the Sunrise, Sunset lace stitch pattern (#139) in the Vogue Knitting Stitchionary Volume 1.

Flying home comes in two sizes. There is a scarfette, designed to utilize a special 50g skein, or the full scarf, which takes 100g of yarn. Samples were knitted in 50g of Plymouth Yarn Happy Feet, a heavy fingering weight yarn, and 100g of Frog Tree Alpaca Sport. Any heavy fingering or sport weight yarn will fit the pattern as guage does not really matter for such a lacey scarf.

I am a biologist first and a knitter second. That said, I love knitted lace, especially botanically inspired lace patterns. I have admired several lace patterns that are called “oak leaf” but couldn’t bring myself to knit them because they were botanically incorrect.   While there is enormous variation in leaf shape within the genus *Quercus*, the existing patterns didn’t seem to be consistent with any common species, and in the few patterns that included acorns, the acorns were not close to being consistent with the leaf shape.  So, my love of leafy lace and my inability to tolerate botanical inconsistencies resulted in this attempt at a somewhat more realistic white oak lace pattern.

The pattern is charted except for set up and finishing.
You can use any yarn with an appropriate needle size (probably 1 size larger than the label suggests.  This pattern will look best in yarns that have good stitch definition.

The scarf is tapered at both ends; the beginning is the tip of the branch and the end is the base of the branch.  The middle of the branch chart can be repeated as many times as desired.  The middle chart can also be used on its own as a lace edging or insert.

I used Cascade 220 Superwash, which is listed as a worsted weight wool.  Based on my experience knitting with it - it knits up more like a dk.  If you are substituting another yarn and want a similar look, I would suggest trying dk or light-worsted weight yarns.",6.0,28,135,4.9,,Worsted

***Textural, delicate and airy.***

This fabric sneaks up on you. At first glance, a passer-by might think 'garter stitch' — but upon closer inspection, it proves to be more clever and complex. Worked in a simple slip stitch pattern on a larger needle than usual, it has a mesh structure that manages to be multi-dimensional and airy at the same time. 

We offer this scarf pattern in two widths; the conventional scarf width requires one skein of [Isager Alpaca 2][1] while the more lavish width shown here will use two skeins and can be worn wrapped, knotted, looped or flung!

It is also a truly unisex pattern, you can decide which way it goes based on your color choice.

Using a mixture of stockinette and garter this pattern was designed to show off the beautiful variegated colors of Malabrigo yarn. Testers have used Malabrigo Sock, Malabrigo Lace held double, Malabrigo Rios and Malabrigo Silky Merino to craft this shawl. All of them worked beautifully.

This classic scarf looks great on men or women and its ample size makes for a luxurious, cozy feel. During our initial design meetings, Julie decided she liked the WS of the texture pattern as much as the RS, so we included instructions for each version. Our samples showcase both variations, as well as two yarn options – the Fossil version is knit with Shelter and creates a softer, more pliable fabric, while the Wool Socks version is knit with Loft doubled for enhanced stitch definition and elasticity. Kirkwood is a no-brainer addition to our favorite winter staples!

The finished weight of Colormeld as pictured is approximately 155 grams, and the scarf measures 7” wide by 60” long.

The pattern stitch is garter-stitch based and is worked over an odd number of stitches, using **yarn-overs** and **K2 together decreases** to create the texture. The finished piece is identical on both sides. Colormeld is a great stash-buster, and can be made in just about any yarn.

To achieve the effect shown in the photos, use two colors of Kureyon, alternating colors every two rows. Pattern includes directions and photos for working with the two colors and carrying yarn up the side.

**The gauge and needle size for Colormeld will depend upon the yarns chosen.** The gauge of the scarf pictured in this pattern is approximately 3.8 sts = 1” on a #9 needle. Add or subtract stitches from the directions to achieve the desired width. Just make sure to always have an odd number.

**Colormeld is completely customizable** and may be worked in one color only, in one solid and one variegated color, or in two solids. Make it in your favorite colors of Kureyon, or experiment with other yarns to find just the perfect combination!

This scarf is the perfect way to send someone off: wrapped up in love. It makes an ideal parting gift, as its classic style (inspired by traditional Aran knitting) wide width, and cabled plushness will keep the wearer warm, and thinking of you for many winters to come. 
**Gauge and Size info:**
While gauge is not overly important, it is vital to note that this pattern was designed to produce a VERY large and wide scarf by most standards. **My finished scarf measured just over 6 feet long and 10.5 inches wide,** without any blocking (as the mostly acrylic yarn really didn’t need it). 
If that’s too much scarf for you, this pattern should work in any yarn, but will look best in something with good stitch definition to show off all the cables.  **My gauge measured in at 5 sts and 5 rows in an inch.** 

There are two versions available: original and anti-curling. The scarf pictured is the original, however the original design curls inward slightly. To counter this, a second version of the pattern was created with seed stitch mixed in. I have published both for your convenience. 
Currently charted instructions are not available for this pattern, but I am working on making them available as soon as possible. ",,41,175,4.75,,Aran
559696,Vinyarnsa,Shelley L Brander,1.89,4.5,1.0,pattern,,"This scarf is extremely simple to make! And I love how it uses the yarn economically - almost no leftovers.

I was inspired by the Vinyasa scarf from Lululemon® (and a video showing a dozen ways to wear it), as well as by the Koigu Carlisle scarf by Espace Tricot and the Color Guru scarf by Lauren L. from Alchemy. That's a lot of inspiration! :)

Like its ready-to-wear Lulu cousin, Vinyarnsa can be worn in a wide variety of ways – buttoned, unbuttoned or partially buttoned, infinity scarf, cowl, bandana or shawl.

Uses 9 - 5/8"" buttons. You'll need #7 straight or circular needles and 6 colors of your favorite fingering yarn - we recommend [Knit Stars' exclusive Sweet 16 yarn from Urth][1]!

A center braid is highlighted on either side by a stockinette rib, followed by a simple cable, and book-ended with a stag-horn rib. Using four balls of Patons woolen DK yarn will yield a scarf roughly 72” long by 6” wide after blocking.

This scarf is an improvement on a cabled scarf I gifted to my previous neighbor last year, which I had called Brighid’s Braid. I kept the center braid motif but have improved on the overall construction of this scarf, as well as tweaking it aesthetically. I had an interesting time knitting this piece – I dropped a couple of stitches, had to unravel incorrectly twisted cables, and when binding off I found one too many stitches on one of my stag-horn ribs. But, even though it took me forever, I finally finished it! I decided to name this scarf “Harvest” because I learned quite a bit while designing and knitting this piece and even walked away with more cable-confidence than I had before. I hope you all enjoy knitting and wearing this scarf!

Of the Forest is a ruffly, light cousin to the Lichen design. I designed it as a companion design to my newest novel [So Wild A Dream][1], and it's named for my character Edna's affinity for the forest.

This scarf uses Garter Stitch, fingering weight yarn and an original two-color eyelet method. The knitting techniques are simple as can be, and the long, flowing shape highlights a gorgeous gradient yarn, like this Brass & Steam colorway from Knitcircus, or any beautiful yarn combination. The Knitcircus skein as shown is 150 grams, but the length on this scarf is easily adjustable for different amounts of yarn.

This piece is inspired by nature, and it was given its name because Turkey Tail Fungus is not an ideal scarf name. :)

###**About the Pattern**###

Tetris is one of my all time favorite games. Something about how the blocks fit together speaks to me. I designed the Tetris Prism Scarf to feature a Tetris game on both ends, with falling blocks along the length of the scarf. Each end has two different possible designs you can choose to knit, for either a well played game or a poorly played game! I imagine it as two people playing a Tetris battle.

Double knit, this scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on each side. Tetris is a colorful game, so I used a rainbow colored yarn to really make the pieces pop.

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished length is approximately 60 inches (152 cm). The length can be increased or decreased by approximately 15 inch (38 cm) intervals. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 350-400 yards (320-366 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn for a 60 inch (152 cm) length scarf.
* Needle to weave in ends.

744681,Peer Pressure,Celia McAdam Cahill,2.55,,,gauge is not critical for this pattern,400.0,"Peer Pressure is a shawlette/scarf that is worked from side to side in one piece, using one skein of fingering weight yarn, based on a simple formula.

First, you weigh your yarn.  Then you work your increases until you have worked up 45% of the yarn weight (or half the desired length, whichever happens first), then begin the center ruffle and decreases.  This ensure you will always have enough yarn to finish your project.

While the design here is a one-skein fingering weight project, feel free to experiment with other weights and yardages, or maybe your own handspun?  

Because the shaping is based on a formula, gauge is not critical, and you can make this shawlette your own!

CC (green) - 180 yds [165 m]

Sample was knit with Malabrigo Rastita (100% Merino Wool; 310 yds/100g) in Glitter (MC) and Mostaza (CC).

It's best to choose a  somewhat sturdy yarn for this scarf. More delicate yarns that create a drapey fabric, such as those with silk content may not work as well. I have knit this design in several yarns and found Malabrigo Rastita and other 100% wool yarns to create the best fabric to wear the scarf in all the ways shown.


NEEDLES: Circular needle in size US 7 (4.5 cm) OR size required to obtain gauge. Scarf is knit flat on a circular needle, so exact length of the needle isn't critical. Anything 24” (60 cm) or longer will work.

NOTIONS: 4 markers, 11 buttons about ½” (1.25cm) in diameter, darning needle for weaving ends.

I welcome you to celebrate your blessings through the knitting of your own Thankful shawl. The act of practicing gratitude is a cornerstone of wholehearted living, and as we enter the giving season, I cannot think of a greater virtue to reflect upon in your knitting.

**Notes**: 
- This shawl has a symmetrical triangular construction using M1R and M1L increases on every right-side row. 
- Every wrong-side row in the entire shawl is knit across. No purl stitches are used.
- This shawl is a repeat of two sections: garter stitch section and beehive waffle stitch section. Each section is comprised of 10 rows each.
- This pattern is written for three shawl sizes; however, it can be adjusted to any desired size by simply adding or omitting garter stitch and/or beehive waffle stitch sections.

878624,Wolves Within Scarf,Celia Cabodevilla,5.87,30.5,4.0,Double knitting,1700.0,"Wolves Within combines double knitting with the artistic technique of pointillism to trick the eye into seeing complex shading, despite only two colorways being used. 

Up close, the pattern appears to be a random collection of dots, but take a few steps back and those dots resolve into beautiful, complex images on both sides. 

The resultant fabric is a delight to wear, with its smooth, squishy finish on both sides and the double-thick construction providing a lightweight scarf without sacrificing warmth. 


***Yardage:***

Main Color: 820 yds of lace weight 
Contrast Color: 820 yds of lace weight

*Note:* Yardage depends on how many colorwork repeats you choose to do in the geometric center section of the scarf.

***Size:*** One size, 8.25""x 81"" (21 cm x 206 cm). However, length is variable.

***Gauge:*** 41 rows and 30.5 stitches per 4"" (10.2 cm) to match pictured sample, but gauge is flexible for this project. 


***Techniques:*** The entire scarf is produced by double knitting flat. It's recommended that new double knitters practice on a swatch or small project before attempting these charts. 

Double knitting is not an advanced technique by any means, but learning while keeping track of such complex colorwork could be quite a lot to process at once. 

This pattern does not include tutorials. 

***The Story:*** The Cherokee fable of the two wolves and the war between them is an an old and much-loved story. It has many versions, changing slightly in the telling from region to region. 

If you’re from North America, you may know it as *The Wolves Within, Two Wolves, Two Dogs, The One You Feed, Feed Both Wolves,* or *Grandfather Tells,*

997199,Professor Umbridge's Cat Scarf,Heather Zoppetti,7.0,27.0,4.0,Stockinette on largest needles,,"The Defense Against the Dark Arts post at Hogwarts is a tough job to fill. Seven different teachers take the post across the eight films, starting with the stuttering Professor Quirrell and ending with the sadistic Professor Carrow (who teaches Dark Arts, rather than defense). But there is perhaps none so universally despised as Dolores Umbridge, who joins the school in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*. Brought to life in the films by Imelda Staunton, who calls her character, “just a delicious baddie,” Professor Umbridge is a pink-wearing, cat-loving Ministry spy masquerading as a teacher. Costume designer Jany Temime says, “I wanted her costumes to appear serious, but always have one detail that was just a bit too much.”

Is this cat scarf a bit too much? You decide. Knit in the round from the tail up, this costume replica takes form with increases and simple wrap and turn short-row shaping and stuffing. After the nose is grafted, ear stitches are picked up and knit in the afterthought thumb style. Button eyes and duplicate stitching bring the cat to life. Meow!

Scarf needs 3 skeins of MC and 1 skein of CC.

*I wanted to design a shawl that honors women and girls with a particular focus on those who have touched our lives but whose story is tainted, forgotten, or was unfairly ended in a way that makes you want to honor her and rewrite her story.  For those women and girls, we knit this project: In Honor of Her Too.*   

*You will begin by knitting side-to-side from the cast on to the bind of edge. The generous yardage will result in a large off-center triangle shape with lots of drape and versatility to be styled various ways. The garter stitch rows are decorated with an all over zig zag eyelet pattern leading up to an icord bow bind off and a picked-up lace section.  You will work an applied lace border for the final bind off. It will be difficult to be bored with this technique-rich project!* 

*The sample project was created to honor the life of Latasha Harlins whose 15 years on earth ended unfairly over a bottle of orange juice.  I often think of her and this means that I have carried her in my heart for nearly 30 years.  For Latasha and others like her, I proudly wear my bow.  Who will your bow honor?   Share the story as you share photos of your WIP, on the Instagram gallery: #mybowhonorsher.*

Knit them all now! This pattern comes with patterns for THIRTY different Gen 1 pokemon! Build your own custom scarf pattern- or knit a bunch of squares to make things like blankets or pillows. This is a great stash buster!

Several different pdf files are included with your purchase. One includes two pages of thumbnails with all of the pokemon facing in both directions so that you can cut them out and play around with layouts. You can see in the photos the thumbnails that my husband chose to build his personal scarf. All 30 pokemon patterns are provided facing in both directions. 

Because it is double knit, the patterns are fully reversible with opposite color schemes on each side. Need help double knitting? Watch my tutorial [here][2]. 

For the scarf, you will need at least two colors of light fingering weight yarn (about 400 yards of each color) and size 2 (2.75mm) needles. For my scarf, I used several different scraps of contrast colors (less than 40 yards each). Since I wanted the neck portion to be tan on each side, I used two balls of tan for that portion, so I needed more than 400 yards. The finished scarf is 5” wide and 64” long, though the length can be adjusted.

For a blanket, the yardage will depend on how many squares you want to do. Using size 2 needles, each of my pokemon were about 5"" wide and 5.5"" tall. You could size up your needles and yarn for bigger squares.

Finished unblocked dimensions are about 75 inches long and 6.5 inches wide. Gauge isn’t too important as long as the knitting is kept loose so that the stitches can expand nicely.

This pattern is suitable for an advanced beginner or intermediate knitter. 

Yarn recommendations: For a consistent scarf fabric appearance, stick to all worsted yarn. Your choice of colors: use up those scraps! Color blending/transition suggestions are given in the directions.

I love the casual versatility and functionality of this wide scarf. Worked in bulky or chunky weight yarn, it knits up quickly while providing extra warmth and squishiness. It’s perfect for a lazy morning inside or a chilly fall evening outside.
The pattern is divided into three sections. A simple cable repeat is worked up one side of the scarf. The middle section is worked without the cabling, and in the last section, the cable pattern is reversed and worked down the other side. A textured seed stitch pattern creates the border. The pockets and fringe are optional additions and the pattern repeat can be increased or lessened to fit the length and style you prefer. The gauge and size given is a guideline; different size yarn and needles will produce a smaller or larger scarf.

1098883,Marvel at this Scarf,Tess Campbell,0.0,34.0,4.0,double knitting,950.0,"Everyone will Marvel at this scarf! It is Marvel-ous! Colors were inspired by comic books. I attempted to include references to as many ""big"" Marvel characters and movies as possible. Clockwise from the bottom right: Falcon, Guardians of the Galaxy, Iron Man, Ant Man, Hawkeye, Dr Strange, Hulk, Black Widow, Captain America, Infinity Stones, Scarlet Witch, Captain Marvel, Wasp, Avengers, Winter Soldier, Spiderman, Thor, Vison, and Black Panther. 

There are TWO patterns included with this purchase, one is for the multicolored version pictured, the other is recolored to just use two colors of yarn. That being said, both are basic two color double knitting- each ""block"" in the multicolored version only uses two colors. The multicolored version looks way cooler in my opinion, but it does require weaving in more ends. Anyway, the point is that you shouldn't be scared by the colors- even relatively new double knitters should be able to handle it. 

Because it is double knit, the scarf is fully reversible with opposite color schemes on each side. If you need help with double knitting, watch my video tutorial [here.][1] 

You will need two colors of light fingering weight yarn for the two color only version (about 435 yards of each color) and size 2 (2.75mm) needles. For the multicolored version, I used remnants left over from previous projects. The finished scarf is 5” wide and 60” long.

**Pattern Features:**

Symmetrical left-right so that you can always read the pattern in the same direction no matter which side you are on.
Symmetrical up-down so that you can easily read your knitting rather than the chart.

**Hints:**
If you are new to double knitting, definitely do a small swatch.  Your tension will almost certainly be different from usual.  Additionally, it is very easy to make the faux linen stitch error mentioned below.   See Appendix 1 for a swatch pattern.

You will be doing a knit one, purl one rib which will make pairs of stitches.  Your knit stitches are the only stitches that will show on that side of the scarf.  Your following purl stitch must always be the opposite color from the knit stitch.  The purl stitch will disappear – only showing as a knit stitch on the reverse side.

Be careful to bring both colors forward and back as you switch from knit to purl and back again.  The yarn being carried must remain between the two stitches in the pair of stitches or it will look like you tried to do a linen stitch.

The charted pattern will only show you the knit stitches.  I have included a written pattern in Appendix 2 if you are not yet comfortable with a chart. 

Since this is reversible, the Circle Color and the Background Color will switch depending on which side of the scarf you are on.

My edging is the simplest that I know but there are other double knitting selvedge choices.  If you decide to do a different solid colored edge, be very careful to twist/catch your yarn on every row or the layers will curl and separate.

Weigh your yarn and weigh your needles.  Write the weights down.  Figure out the weight in yarn of one full pattern.  This way you can use all of your yarn for a longer scarf.  This pattern looks good if you stop at either the end of a full pattern or halfway through on Row 16.

I find a Norwegian knitting thimble helpful; however, I did not start double knitting with one and I knit continental.  It does make my tension tighter so I would not start using one in the middle of a project.

You can use 1 yarn for the entire project or multiple colors. Each Clue was done  in a single color yarn.  Some clues can be done in variegated, but I would not recommend a highly variegated yarn.

This project will have lace knitting in every section. I used a size 7 needle, but I'm a very loose knitter, so you may need to use a size 8.

Each Clue will have Terms for that section.

The first Clue will be released on Friday October 8 and the other 5 on subsequent Fridays.

",650.0,"These may be my most satisfying cables yet!  Working them was a blast, and the gorgeous slanted pattern shows up beautifully in a squishy merino worsted like Jill Draper's Windham. 

Tailspin showcases the pattern so that both the large and smaller cables really pop, traveling in elegant lines across the width of the scarf. 

The outside lines of the cable pattern stand out against a narrow garter stitch border and a distinct edge, and tassels really bring it on home for a statement piece that's bound to stand up to just about any outfit. 

This pale lilac shade (Frost) is a color that makes me happy even in the dreary days of February - but Jill has a ton of gorgeous Windham shades available here.  If Frost is sold out, I suggest choosing one of the more subtle semi-solid colorways to allow the pattern to show up best. 

Notes are in the pattern in case you want to modify size, and all cable instructions are both charted and written. 

As with all handdyed yarns, be sure to alternate skeins as needed.

This amazingly warm shawl is my goto addition for a dressy night out. Light and delicate, Elbert will keep your bare shoulders cozy. The name comes from the highest peak in the Colorado Rockies, Mount Elbert (14,440 feet).  The lofty and light cloud-like texture of this yarn is a reminder of the atmosphere one would experience on a Rocky Mountain summit. 

The Elbert shawl is perfect as a spring or summer accessory. This might also be a knitting inspiration as a special gift for a beautiful bride to wear in the evening at her summer wedding.

The result is an airy, three-season piece that you could whip up for your own favorite charity... or just yourself!

**Construction:**
A garter edge surrounding eyelets and stockinette make for a simple but timeless pattern. Alternating-width stripes add a little bit of interest to a classic, symmetrical shawl pattern. Knit from the point out, this shawl can be as large or as small as you wish. I personally prefer more scarf-sized shawls, but you are welcome to make yours larger if you prefer blanket-type shawls.

“Every leaf speaks bliss to me, fluttering from the Autumn tree.” ~Emily Bronte~

Fall weather is perfect for a cravat, not quite cold enough for a thick scarf, yet cool enough to need a little something around your neck.  With a pretty leaf at both ends, it is more like a piece of jewelry.  Knit this up in any weight yarn you like, using a thicker yarn will give you a cozier scarf, using lighter weight yarn will give you more of a necklace look.  The two shown were made with worsted weight and aran weight yarn, but any yarn could be used.  It's a great way to use up some left over yarn from other projects! 

Knits up quickly and is a great take-along project to work on while watching the kids at soccer or baseball.  Or when you are waiting at the doctors office or when traveling.  

Skill level:
beginner/advanced beginner - requires basic knowledge of knitting
There are no charts to read and the stitch patterns are easy enough for a beginning knitter to work.
The scarf is completely reversible so it looks beautiful no matter how you decide to wear it! 

Materials needed:
YARN: 100-150 yards of any weight yarn - actual yardage depends on how long you make your scarf, the orange scarf shown was made with 100 yards of worsted weight Madeline Tosh Vintage yarn in ""Spicewood"", the cream colored scarf was made with 150 yards of Aran weight Knit Picks City Tweed Aran in “snowshoe”, see below for finished measurements.
NEEDLES: Size of needle required depends on the yarn you use, I used a size US 8 (5mm) for the worsted weight orange cravat, and size US 9 (5.5mm) for the Aran weight cream cravat
OTHER MATERIALS:
Cable needle
Crochet hook in the same size as the needles you will be using

This scarf is knit in two modular triangles and then grafted together along its central diagonal line. If not using a color for more than 2 rows, break the color and rejoin it later.

Gauge is not critical for this pattern, but using a different yarn weight or needle size will affect the size of the finished scarf.

###**About the Pattern**

Knit this elegant Celtic dog scarf for the dog lover in your life!

Surrounded by beautiful Celtic knots, the paired dogs in the Celtic Dog Scarf intertwine their tails to join in the expanding knotwork. Celtic knot designs have long been featured in knitted garments and accessories, and this scarf is perfect for a love of dogs with an artistic flair!

Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on either side. Use two solid colors for a classic look or a solid paired with a variegated yarn for a more interesting color combination (gradual or subtle color changes work best). There are two sizes of dogs and multiple ear shapes. Work all the dogs or just your favorite if you prefer!

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished size of the scarf is approximately 70 inches (178 cm) in length and 5.25 inches (13.3 cm) in width. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 430 yards (393 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn.
* Needle to weave in ends.

That was when I realized that the snowflake colorwork on the ends reminded me of damask. Damask is an intricately woven and reversible fabric originally made in Damascus. Also, appropriately given the wool/silk blend of Empire, it was made of silk and wool. Hope you enjoy my little nod to fiber history.

Designed to increase the already decadent squishiness of some lofty handspun angora-merino wool yarn, this brioche scarf is addictive once you get it started!

7292774,Steppingstones Scarf,Amy P Swanson,0.0,23.5,4.0,lace,308.0,"Steppingstones Scarf is knit flat from end to end in basic lace stitches with spots of stockinette stitch peppered in for interest. Slipped stitches create finished side edges. Finished dimensions: 6.75”/ 17 cm width, 51”/ 129.5 cm length.

The name Steppingstones has double meaning for this scarf. First, it denotes the spots of stockinette stitch that interrupt the lace columns in a random looking yet planned way. The name also reflects why this scarf was designed – as a steppingstone for knitters to work with June Cashmere’s fingering weight yarn for the first time. Knit with larger needles, the yarn is worked in a basic lace pattern, resulting in an airy yet warm scarf. Because the lace pattern is basic, it’s also a steppingstone for knitters experimenting with lace for the first time. Knit from just one skein of June Cashmere fingering yarn, this is a relatively quick project that yields a beautiful result, with enough technique interest that knitters of all abilities can enjoy making it.

Note: Please see June Cashmere [errata page][1] for any error corrections. The most update version of this pattern is dated 1/10/2024 (in the footer of the pattern).

***

This symmetrical scarf is a playground for simple textures using a deceptively simple technique, called intarsia colorwork. In this design, intarsia colorwork is used to work two colors across the row, letting you build a gradient (worked in half-fisherman’s rib) on one side of the scarf, while the other side is worked in a single color in garter stitch – preferably in a fluffy lace weight yarn, such as a Suri alpaca yarn, or even one that contains brushed cashmere, gives an amazingly squishy but airy texture that’s next-to-skin soft.

This scarf has a simple construction, it’s worked from one point to the other, all in one piece. All stitches and textures are simple (and use simple increases and decreases to shape the ends), and the half-fisherman’s rib is written out in detail, so that it is easy to learn if you’re new to this stitch! To form your gradient, you can use as many colorways as you’d like - the sample used eight colors total (**seven 20g minis + one 100g skein**). I strongly recommend weighing your skeins as you go to avoid running out of yarn on the second half of your shawl if you are doing a symmetrical gradient, and I provide a worksheet you can use if you’d like to keep track of your skein weights and stitch counts during color transitions (this worksheet is totally optional, I found it helpful but it’s okay if you don’t)!

[Here][1] is a link to the project page for the sample.

**Dimensions**: approximately 23” wide x 92” in length (58 cm wide x 233 cm in length)

* It’s very easy to adjust the dimensions of this scarf while blocking – I chose to block my sample more aggressively lengthwise, to give a longer and more narrow scarf

* See Schematic Diagram in attached photos (also on page 3 of the pattern)

**Needles**: size US 4 / 3.5 mm 32” circular knitting needles

**Yarn**: at least two colors of fingering/lace weight yarn

* Solid Color (or “SC”): 650 yards / 595 meters of a fluffy lace-weight yarn (sample used Magpie Fibers – Plume, in the colorway Selkie)

* Fade Colors (or “FC”): 850 yards / 780 meters of a fingering weight yarn in a gradient arrangement (sample used Woolberry Fiber Co. – Berry Sock and Berry Merino (7x20g skeins and 1x100g skein))

* **Note**: if you choose to add tassels, two tassels will require an additional ~70 yards / 64 meters of yarn

**Gauge**: 27 sts x 40 rows = 4” x 4” (10 cm x 10 cm) in half-fisherman’s rib, worked flat and blocked more aggressively lengthwise.

* Half-fisherman’s rib is worked as follows for flat knitting, across an even number of stitches:
RS: *sl1yo, p1* to end
WS: *k1, brp* to end

**Notions**: (recommended) scale to weigh yarn, one stitch marker, one removable stitch marker (or row counter), tapestry needle

This scarf is knit from end to end with Hurdle Stitch, which is made up of only knits and purls. The stitch works up in a lovely springy, spongy, allover texture that is also reversible.

The gradient effect is achieved by holding two strands of the same yarn together and staggering the starting points of each skein on the scarf. Two skeins are required, though only half of each will be used. (The other two halves can produce a second scarf in a very different colorway, if desired.)

One day I realized that, aside from my first knitting project, I had yet to knit a nice scarf for myself. I knew that I couldn't sport something boring and be proud that I'd knit it, so I set up a bunch of cables and went to town: two on the sides and a larger one in the center. After a couple of repeats, it's pretty easy to memorize and take with you on the bus or train. I've knit a few Antlers Scarves now and can crank one out in a couple of Saturday afternoons of steady coffee drinking and marathon knitting- and I consider myself a slow knitter. It's a great project if you've never tried cables before and really want something to show off when you're done. And its rugged looks mean it will look great whether worn on a boys-only fishing trip or to a fancy seafood restaurant.

Note: Gauge is not essential for this project.

**From the pattern:**
This scarf began as an experiment in combining different types of reversible cables to create a deeply textured fabric.

I used a simple ribbed cable to set off braided cables whose balanced knit and purl stitches change places to produce the same pattern on both sides.

All of the cables are done on one side of the work, with purl crosses as well as the traditional knit and knit-purl ones.

The scarf is warm and dense, a guaranteed shield against wintry blasts on a misty moor or an urban street.

217389,Seaweed Stole/Scarf,Turquoise Owl Fibers,1.92,,,,300.0,"**Seaweed Stole/Scarf**

The idea for this stole originated from a kayak trip. This past August my brother and I went on a 4 1/2 hr. kayak trip. I didn't have a waterproof container for my camera so wasn't able to take it along, although later I wished I had been able to. The scenery along the way was stunning! It was a beautiful day for kayaking; sunny, not too hot, and with a gentle breeze. 
While we were gliding down the river I noticed the seaweed (not sure what the technical term would be, we'll just call it seaweed) that was streaming along with the river's current. It had tall, long leaves, and all sorts of beautiful colors. Right away I though it would be wonderful to dye some yarn in those colors. The main colors were shades of green, yellow, chartreuse, and a mauve-ish pink.
The next day I had the opportunity to over-dye a skein of my handspun in the exact colors, while they were still fresh in my memory. I was so pleased with the results that I decided to design a pattern that went with my seaweed theme.
This pattern is perfect because the waves in the feather and fan design reflect not only the movement of the water, but also the graceful motion of the seaweed as it ripples in the water.

I hope you enjoy knitting this as much as I did!

226252,Stochastic Fantastic,Emily Williams,3.2,5.0,1.0,stockinette,270.0,"“Stochastic” is nerdy statistics lingo for random.  Knitting is normally very orderly and predictable – quite un-stochastic.  So could you design a pattern that could emulate the chaotic beauty of nature?  Trees in a forest, ripples on a lake, snowflakes …

You can, by using the power of stochasticity - randomness! So, for this project, chance will guide your scarf gradually transitioning from plain stockinette stitch to a field of flowers.  Rolling a die to determine flower placement, every single person's creation will be unique!

Thanks go to Barbara Walker for the inspiration for the flower motif and to my dad (an economics professor, and my backpacking buddy) for the name of the pattern.  Photos by the incomparable Vivian Aubrey.

GAUGE
20 stitches = 4”/10 cm in stockinette stitch measured after blocking. Gauge is *NOT* crucial, but will affect finished size and yardage. Biased fabric is extra-stretchy, as is thin mohair yarn worked at an open gauge as shown here.

FINISHED MEASUREMENTS
Width: 6""/15 cm (measured perpendicular to edges) 
Width of row: about 7""/18 cm (diagonal to edges) 
Length: about 54”/137 cm (or desired length) 
Measured after blocking

CONSTRUCTION
This scarf is knit flat on the bias. It begins with plain stockinette stitch, then more and more flowers are gradually added. Flower placement is determined by rolling a die, so every person's creation will be unique.

SKILL LEVEL
Intermediate: lace, non-traditional instructions

YARN
Amount: Approximately 230-270 yards/210-250 meters of a yarn or combination of yarns that yields a fabric you like at the specified gauge. Yardage can vary with yarn weight and row gauge.

Character: Fuzzy and single-ply yarns offer a pleasingly organic texture. We suggest lace-weight mohair OR worsted OR fingering held along with lace (requires full yardage of each yarn).

Shown in: yellow/green scarf is Schulana Kid Seta in 06 Kiwi (lace-weight 70% kid mohair, 30% silk). 
Dark green scarf is Less Traveled Yarns Baby Suri (lace-weight 74% baby suri alpaca, 26% silk) in Mallard. Swatches (left to right) show: Malabrigo Worsted in Frank Ochre; Malabrigo Mechita in Frank Ochre, held with Lang Mohair Luxe in 114; and Lang Mohair Luxe in 114. All swatches get gauge and used the same needles.

NEEDLES
US #7/4.5 mm OR size to get gauge

NOTIONS
Darning needle, optional: stitch markers, blocking pins and wires, 6-sided die

UPDATED 3/22
* New layout
* Gauge adjusted from 6 to 5 stitches per inch. This makes the finished object slightly larger, creates a more open fabric that shows off the flowers better, and allows more flexibility in yarn substitutions and combinations.

* Removed slip stitch from beginning of garter edge
* Clearer chart coloring

Neap Tide is worked at a loose gauge to provide drape.

A Neap Tide is a tide that occurs when the difference between high and low tide is least; the lowest level of high tide. The name was inspired by the shape of the wrap itself and the edging; both are gently curved and wave with no extreme highs or lows.

This scarf is the first pattern I ever released, and it was designed to teach a beginners knitting class. In fact it was the pattern I sent knitters away with once we had spent the afternoon working hard on our knit and purl stitches. I’ve taken the original short and skinny scarf designed not to intimidate knitters into a scarf that I actually want to wear. The main factor? Squish. And a lot of it. I reworked the scarf to be almost 6 feet allowing a good wrap around the neck and shoulders, and it is wide, allowing it to be worn more like a shawl if wanted. The stitch pattern is a classic one, encouragingly memorable, and comfortably exercises the change between knit and purl. And in Elsa Wool’s Woolen-Spun? The knitted fabric is so so buttery soft, light and warm, you won't want to stop knitting.

It produces wines suitable for everyday drinking that are soft, fruity and ready-to-drink when released. The Italian word dolcetto means ""little sweet one"", but Dolcetto wines are nearly always dry. As a shawlette, Dolcetto is, indeed, a little sweet one. Knitted in one piece, from the neck down in stockinette with a double leaf spine, it is a perfect pairing for that special skein of sock yarn. The shawlette is finished with a double leaf edge that flows from the body of the shawl.  Wear it as a shawl or a sassy scarf and you’ll be ready to sit and sip under an Italian sunset.*

265288,Double Leaf Saroyan,L Abinante,3.43,16.0,4.0,stockinette,420.0,"[Saroyan][3] was the third pattern in a series inspired by the television show Bones. The shawl was such a big hit that when a Raveler posted modifications for a double leaf version, I compiled it into a pattern and published it with her permission. Previous patterns in the Bones series include [Traveling Woman][4] and [Temperance][5].

This pattern is quite a bit more basic than the original version of Saroyan. If you’re looking for information on customizing your Double Leaf Saroyan, you will need to look at the [original version of Saroyan][2]. Information on custom sizing is not included in this pattern.

Double Leaf Saroyan contains **charts only** (no written instructions) and **is meant to serve as a modification to the original pattern rather than a stand-alone pattern.**

The sample shown is set up leaves, 12 increase leaves, 11 decrease leaves, and edge leaves and used 2 skeins Malabrigo Rios.

Dr. Camille Saroyan is intelligent, graceful, and uncompromisingly organized. The simple lace scarf would fit right at home in sleek and professional wardrobe.

Knit in one piece from start to finish, Saroyan is a perfect project for beginning lace knitters. This tapered scarf can be worn a variety of ways, and the construction helps to keep your neck nice and cozy. The lace edging used in this scarf is from a stitch dictionary titled Super Stitches Knitting. A garter stitch border rolls over nicely, so you only see the stocking stitch body and lovely lace edging. (This rolling can be prevented if desired.)

Much like Traveling Woman, this pattern is easily adjusted to your preference. Like the triangular shawl shape instead? Simply knit more repeats of the increase section, and then begin your decreases immediately. Prefer fingering weight yarn? Bust out your scale and weigh your yarn periodically.

Don't be afraid to be bold with this pattern. It can be knit in almost any yarn weight in practically any size. The increase, decrease, and straight sections are designed so that they can be easily added or subtracted to the pattern.

This any-gauge scarf is a very simple project, but by using all leftover yarn scraps to work each row in a different color, and by working it asymmetrically, you'll make a completely unique work of art for your neck - vary yarn weights and textures as well as color for the most interesting looking fabric.  

The easy garter-stitch-esque stitch pattern is worked lengthwise with very basic short rows (no need to deal with wrapping, since there is no turning!), always starting at the same end, making one end of the scarf twice the width of the other end.  Tails are left along both edges for fringe.  

This pattern is ideal for using up yarn scraps of all different lengths, including very short lengths.  If you don't want to use leftovers, you can use any kind of yarn you want, but to get a fabric that looks like the samples, each row should be a different color from the last.  Use yarn in any weight you like, as any gauge will work.

You'll need 2 long circular needles (the longer the better for at least one of them) to make this piece, but they can be different sizes from each other.",5.0,30,85,4.73,any size,Any gauge

The muse of dance and choral music, Terpsichore’s name means literally “delight in dance.” What better place to find such a muse in the modern day, than in New Orleans, Louisiana? This music and dance filled city boasts a series of streets named after muses. Terpsichore is there with her sisters, and in the Terpsichore finger park where the statue “Birth of a Muse” - the first public artwork commissioned since Hurricane Katrina - shows her emerging from a trumpet flower.

Terpsichore’s shawl is a classic beauty, showing the fleur-de-lis, a symbol of New Orleans, surrounded by a delicate mesh. The smallest version, in fingering weight yarn, is bound off with a simple picot edge. The larger laceweight versions, one with a strip of beads and sequins fit for a night on the town, feature a knitted on edging.

Welcome to year two! The idea for [my first ebook subscription (year one: the pleiades)][2] was born in 2010 while reading posts on Ravelry:  people  knitting  10  shawls  in  2010. This year, they are doing 11 in 2011, so I really must join in the fun!

I am still addicted to small shawls using sock yarn and my sock yarn stash is still growing. And growing. It seems to be be bigger every day! So I’m jumping in again!

This time, because of life happening, the deadline of designing and knitting all of the 7 shawls for this subscription in 2011 is, I'm afraid, not possible. (Though I am still on track to design and knit 11 shawls in 2011!!) But the patterns for this eBook subscription will be delivered to subscribers within the subscription period of a year: ending June 30, 2012. As this is a challenge to myself to design, knit and release 7 shawls in the period of a year, I did not set a specific delivery time for each pattern.

All patterns will have charts and written instructions, and you will be able to make them out of one skein of sock yarn or an amount of sock yarn comparable to that needed for a pair of socks. There will be a few little extras sprinkled throughout and all patterns will be available to purchase separately.

The Muses will be the theme for year two. Yes, there are 9 muses, not 7! This means that not every muse will have a shawl. But each muse will have a pattern in the book.

Are you ready? Happy knitting!

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

As this is a challenge to myself to design, knit and release 7 shawls in the period of a year, I did not set a specific delivery time for each pattern.

All patterns will have charts and written instructions, and you will be able to make them out of one skein of sock yarn or an amount of sock yarn comparable to that needed for a pair of socks. There will be a few little extras sprinkled throughout and all patterns will be available to purchase separately.

The Muses will be the theme for year two. Yes, there are 9 muses, not 7! This means that not every muse will have a shawl. But each muse will have a pattern in the book.

Are you ready? Happy knitting!

*Note that purchasing the eBook represents a significant discount over purchasing each pattern separately. No refunds can be given for buying the patterns separately and then, at a later date, purchasing the complete eBook. If you have made a single pattern purchase in error and wished to purchase the book instead, please contact me within a week to resolve the issue. Thank you!*

This scarf is made using a Brioche stitch combined with a traveling cable. The turtleneck section is also made using one of the brioche stitches. Brioche stitches tend to have a fullness and dimensionality not found in other knitting stitches. This one is bordered with a garter stitch which is slightly wavy as a result of the traveling cables. If you're a good knitter, but are unfamiliar with the brioche family of stitches, you won't enjoy this pattern. (There is several simpler brioche patterns in my shop if you would like to try an easier brioche stitch first.) This pattern is both charted and written out line by line.

Skill Level: Advanced - Advanced+ (assuming a excellent working knowledge of knitting, slipped stitches, cabling and brioche knitting.)  If you're not familiar with brioche knitting, this is not the pattern for you).

This pattern is charted only.

The sample was expertly test knitted by Jude who can be reached at uputat@yahoo.com,(and is known on Ravelry as Uputat. It was knitted using Lorna's Laces Shepherd Sport Weight yarn in colorway, Fjord. https://lornas-laces.myshopify.com/collections/all/shepherd-sport)Since this yarn is no longer available, I would recommend Fleece Artists BFL Sport, but any plied sport yarn should work equally well.

The pattern is for sale here in Ravelry and in my Etsy Shop in the Brioche Knits Section (https://www.etsy.com/shop/WearableArtEmporium?section_id=44053362)

And is available in my Knit Unique E-Book #1 sold here on Ravelry:

Zaggy is attractive on the back as well as the front and will not curl. The decorative scalloped edges are self-forming; just follow the pattern!

Zaggy is a great stash-buster, which is how the design came about!

**The gauge of the scarf as pictured**, worked with worsted-weight stash yarns, is approximately 6.8 sts = 1"" on a #9 needle in pattern stitch.

Finished measurements of Zaggy as photographed are 7 1/2"" wide by 60"" long. 

The sample scarf took approximately 110 grams (250 meters) of each of two worsted-weight stash yarns, one solid, one variegated. A single ply yarn works well.

Zaggy can be made wider or narrower if desired.

**ERRATA**: There was a misplaced asterisk in Row 2 of the pattern stitch in the original version of this pattern. This has now been corrected.

Soda Water is a giant cozy scarf featuring offset columns of big bold cables and just a bit of lace.  I had been waiting to use these cables for a long time now - too bold for a garment, but perfect on an accessory - and as soon as I swatched them on the Traveler, I knew they had to be featured on a long, woofy scarf.  I lengthened them just a tad, so they are not perfect circles, and the oval shape adds to the feeling of length and drape here.  

The Traveler is worked on #9 needles, for an extra bit of drape, and the silk content in the yarn lends both sheen and softness to the scarf.

At the time, I was still working in twisted stitches as a preference, so this one is worked that way. Ironically, it was also the last one to be bound off. It’s done in Kauni Effektgarn, my very favorite yarn for double-knitting. Parallax patterns and Kauni go together beautifully -- the long color gradations are shown off to their best extent, and if you pair two Kaunis together, you will always have the excitement of seeing how the colors will play off each other as you go. Sometimes they’ll contrast really well and sometimes you’ll get two together that are fairly close -- but at that point, the Parallax pattern gives you the added bonus of this shimmery effect where another pattern might be lost. In the two I chose here, the darker color may appear solid but is actually shifting from a rich blue to a black to a deep purple.

If you decide to work without beads then just skip all the instructions that have to do with beads!  Easy!  

**Optional Beads** 
**Option 1 (two color option):**
Approx. 30 grams size 8/0 glass seed beads, col A (Clues #1, 2, 3 & 4) Approx. 20 grams size 8/0 glass seed beads, col B (Clues #1, 2, 3 & 4) 
*OR*
**Option 2 (one color option):** 
Approx. 50 grams size 8/0 glass seed beads (Clues #1, 2, 3 & 4)

475129,Caterpillar Hug,Becky Lee,1.67,16.0,4.0,stockinette,437.0,"This pattern uses the double knitting technique: you’ll be knitting two connected pieces of fabric at once on the same set of needles. The result is a scarf with two right sides, with the same two-color pattern reversed from one side to the other.

When double knitting, your final product will show nothing but knits (stockinette) on both sides. To achieve this, every other stitch you work will be a purl.

If you’re unfamiliar with double knitting, I recommend the fantastic video demonstration on planetpurl’s YouTube channel.

I used thicker yarn and needles for a chunky scarf. If you’d like a thinner, narrower scarf, just use thinner yarn and needles.

Gauge is not important, except that it be a final texture that will drape nicely. This sample scarf uses 50g of Knitpicks Chroma fingering, 396yds/100g, color ‘Azalea’. 

The diamonds are designed so that the pattern looks good from both front and back, and also do not roll in at the edges. Because of this though the non-lace rows have a combination of knit/purl sts and so attention to the pattern is required. I consider this to be an intermediate level pattern, but also interesting for an experienced lace knitter.

While this pattern is written for one skein of Rowan Kidsilk Haze, some knitters may find that more yarn is required to complete the length in the pattern.

Each pattern in the collection carries a central theme – cables and lace. Interchangeably, these cables and lace stitch combinations have evolved into other designs – each with their own unique style. Fiona adds a lace pattern to Phoebe’s cable. She can be made as a wide scarf or a larger wrap/stole with added repeats.

The knitting skill level is intermediate and above. Knowledge of cables and lace work (yarn over increases, single/double decreases) is necessary. The pattern is both written and charted for easy interpretation. Use a cotton or linen yarn to knit Fiona as the perfect spring, summer or fall wrap; or choose a nice alpaca or wool for a comfy, warm, wide winter scarf.

Willamette is active knitting with cables on every row, but the geometric motifs are predictable and easy to track. The pattern can be worked in Shelter for oversized coziness or in Loft for a scarf of more traditional scale.

608288,The Ubiquitous First Garter Stitch Scarf,Jodie Gordon Lucas,0.0,,,gauge is not important,288.0,"**Announcing: *The  Queen’s Garters*!!  An ebook collection of 16 garter stitch patterns by designer, teacher and self appointed monarch  Jodie Gordon Lucas. Available October 2015 through Ravelry and www.QueenieKnits.com.**

""What do you want to make?""…Queenie   
									   
I have taught many people how to knit.  Whenever I ask this question I’m inevitably told “a scarf”.  This first scarf is worked in garter stitch (every row is knit) and is perhaps the most important project in the life of a knitter.  This is where they will flourish or flounder in the craft.  This is where they make an almost metaphysical transformation…they become (cue drum roll) “A Knitter”.

When I decided to offer a free garter stitch pattern to celebrate the release of “The Queen’s Garters”,  I realized there was no better herald to a garter stitch collection than a tutorial for that Ubiquitous First Garter Stitch Scarf.  Relying on my years of (mostly successful) teaching, I’ve divided this tutorial into 4 skill building sessions.  Each session offers tasks, tricks and tips as well as common mistakes to avoid. By the time you bind off you will be able to proudly call yourself “A Knitter” (and have a cool scarf, too)!!

608739,Sugar Cane Scarf,Laura Rasmussen,0.0,28.0,4.0,stockinette,350.0,"This scarf was designed to play with the variegated colors and drape of Araucania *Caña Ruca*, which is made out of sugar cane viscose. The Sugar Cane Scarf incorporates eyelets in a bed of stockinette as well as dropped & twisted stitches.  I thought the dropped stitches would add interest and break up any pooling that the yarn might naturally want to do. 

**Size:** 5"" wide x 39"" long. You can adjust the width as long as you increase or decrease in 12 stitch increments. The length can easily be shortened or lengthened as well.

**Gauge:** 28 sts/4"" in stockinette. The gauge does not need to be exact.

**Yarn:** 1 skein Araucania *Caña Ruca* OR  300-350 yards of another sport weight yarn. 

I think this pattern could be used beautifully with other yarns - of any weight. Try a hand-dyed yarn or a wool yarn or a cotton yarn or a self-striping yarn! 

**Needles:** US 7/4.5mm - if you are using the *Caña Ruca*, I would suggest wooden needles as the yarn is very slippery. Some people may find straight needles easier to use due to the dropped stitches.

623970,Damara,Jennifer Wood,4.33,18.0,4.0,double knit ,,"> I named these scarves Damara for the damask inspired design worked in the double knit section. Damara is a fun scarf that incorporates the two techniques: double knitting and two color brioche. It starts with the pretty double knitted design, then moves seamlessly into two color brioche for the body of the scarf and then ends with the double knitted design. I used Plucky Snug Worsted for the sample, a wonderful yarn that is perfect for this design. There is a thorough description of each technique and helpful hints. Even if you are not familiar with these techniques, these pretty scarves would be a great way to expand your knitting knowledge!

**Knit Testers:**

[knitbyhand](person)
knitbyhand used a different CO method, check out her project page [here][4] for details.

Size: 69"" long and 6"" wide, blocked. 60” long and 6"" wide, unblocked.

**Materials:**
   **Yarn:** Plucky Knitter Snug Worsted, 70% merino, 20% cashmere, 10% alpaca; 230 yds (210 m) per 115g skein; color: Scarf A, Pup Tent & Hi-Ho Silver (green and light gray scarf), Scarf B, Tin Type & Cherries On the Mall (dark gray and pink scarf), 1 skein of each color. 
   **Needles:** Size 7/4.5mm circular needles.
   **Other:** Locking marker or safety pin to mark RS, tapestry needle. 
**Gauge:** 18 sts and 22 rows = 4"" in Double Knit (Since this is the Double Knit gauge there will actually be 36 sts on the needle, but only 18 will be showing). Gauge is not critical.

**Notes:**
This scarf is reversible. The ends are worked in double knitting and the center in two-color brioche stitch. I find that when working reversible scarves, it is helpful to mark the RS with a locking stitch marker or a safety pin. 
Gauge is not critical and any yarn weight between a DK and worsted works well for this pattern. To make sure you do not run out of yarn I would suggest weighing your skeins before you start and then again after you finish the beginning double knit section. This will give you the weight of yarn needed to work the ending double knit section, so you can work the brioche section to your desired length, leaving enough yarn to finish the ending double knit section.

Growing mainly in Northern California, redwood trees are the largest and tallest trees in the world. They can live thousands of years but are endangered from logging, air pollution, and habitat loss. The tallest living tree is a redwood named Hyperion that lives in Northern California; its location kept a secret to help protect it. The redwood’s beautiful orange-red bark changes and shifts in the varying light creating an enigmatically strong yet fragile 
impression.

The *Identitatum Arborum* collection of knitting patterns was created in conjunction with an art installation made for the Heritage Museums and Gardens in Sandwich, Massachusetts in summer 2016 for the Natural Threads exhibition. In that art installation I explored the idea of identity using trees as a metaphor.

I must give credit to Kristen of Studio knit for the idea of 80 stitches per row on size 6 16"" circular needles, for using the color gold, and for the method of measuring and using the tassels to tie off the ends of the scarf. This was my first project when I learned how to knit, and my first post to Ravelry! Let's get started!


MATERIALS

* Needles used: US size 6 circular needles, 16"" in length (I used Clover by Takumi wooden needles)

* Yarn used: Lion Brand Vanna's Choice color ""Burgundy"" x4 skeins 
Lion Brand Wool-Ease color ""Gold"" x1 skein

* Additional helpful tools: Tapestry needle or crochet hook for finishing

The finished scarf measures approximately 71"" long (excluding tassels on the end) and 7"" wide, and it is VERY warm since it is double thick. My wife and I live in Indianapolis, and we have recently had a bout of weather where the high temperature for the day was 15 degrees, and my wife was happy to report that the scarf kept her warm on her walk from her car her office each day.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to send me a message and I will clarify anything you need. Enjoy!

Aggressive increasing and decreasing within the motif contributes to deep scallops at the ends and playful movement of shading along the length of the piece. As shown, the design is worked in two pieces from hem to center back and joined with a graft. This design could easily be worked in gradient or color block stripes by changing yarn shades at the start of each pattern band.

This pattern is an adaptation of the ZickZack Scarf Pattern by Christy Kamm. I loved the pattern so much, that I wanted to write a new version using my own ColorMix Aran weight yarn. I changed the zig-zag section just a wee bit, and I’ve also added an i-cord edge, which hides the color changes and creates a nice tailored edge. The i-cord is the only thing that changes on your knit and purl side. The body of the scarf is one row you knit over and over. Super easy to memorize and great for social knitting or TV time. :)

That’s the source of inspiration for Understoried's flowing leaf and branch motifs.

But underneath that story is another, deeper one: Each of us has our own understory, made up of the people “behind the scenes” who hold us up and the stories that make us who we are. Understoried is a tribute to this often hidden, always vital part of each of us. The design began life as a thank-you for two people who supported me through a difficult season: the scarf for a friend and the wrap for my mother. It makes a wonderful gift for a special someone in your life—especially if you share the inspiration behind it with them!

Knit on the bias, both sizes of Understoried drape beautifully no matter how you wear them. Choose the single-skein version for a lightweight scarf or the large, luxurious wrap for a cozier piece. Or, use the pattern notes to create your very own custom size.

Instructions are both written and charted, so you'll be comfortable knitting, whatever your preference might be. The pattern has been tech edited and test knit, so you can cast on with confidence!

 **You will need:**

- fingering-weight yarn,
 approximately 100g /400 meters total 

- short circular needles US size 5 (3.75mm). 
DPNs are OK, but circulars are more convenient. 

- 10 locking markers (you can use staples instead). 
Regular markers won’t work!

The prototype weights 100g and measures 160 cm long with 27cm wide main body. 
You can use different color leftovers (I did), 
or two gradient, or gradient/solid yarn. 

This pattern is included in Stars e-book.

826115,Manta Ray Scarf,Scott Timothy,4.73,22.0,4.0,blocked garter stitch,840.0,"This unexpectedly simple pattern makes a surprisingly intricate piece that will be sure to draw compliments. The drape ripples from beginning to end, blending one yarn into to the next. The pattern plays with the conventional way things are done and it begs to be knit in imaginative color combinations. Creating your own unique garment is half the fun of this one, so mix and match, find your artistic inspiration, and enjoy!

This pattern is named from the idea of peering through the ripples of the ocean’s surface and spotting a manta ray lazily gliding along the ocean floor below. The manta ray’s long thin tail contrasts against its wide spotted body, & the illusion makes it appear as if the manta ray has myriads of undulating wings fluttering in the water. In the same way, this drape is separated into three segments: the long thin Tail, the repeating Body, and the pointy Head. 

This scarf is purposefully wide enough to be worn more like a shawl, being wrapped around the neck or draped over the shoulders, without the bulk of a standard shawl,  OR, as a normal scarf! Gauge is specifically large to add lots of drape, without losing stitch definition. Finished length is suggested to be about 7 feet (213 cm) but can be adjusted in approximately 12 inch (30 cm) increments to be shorter or longer, based on the number of repeats and yarns you use.

This pattern includes written instructions using pattern repeats and stitch markers and a more comprehensive breakdown, detailing every row and stitch. The entire pattern is fully charted. A pattern schematic and a notes & notions section are also included.",5.0,20,40,4.9,,Fingering
827960,Mark VI Monorail Scarf,Periodic Knits,0.0,28.0,4.0,Double Knitting,1200.0,"This scarf is based on the design of the Mark VI Monorail System used at the Walt Disney Resort. The Walt Disney World Monorail System transports guests from the Transportation and Ticket Center to either Magic Kingdom Park, Epcot, or any of the Resorts around the Seven Seas Lagoon. The sample scarf was made using Destination Yarn's First Class Silk in the colors Cinderella's Castle and Spaceship Earth, paralleling the linking of the two Parks represented by the Mark VI Monorail.

This scarf will use 600 yards of each of two colors (1200 yards total) if knit as shown. The pattern includes an optional modification to shorten the scarf to match the design of the Mark V Monorail formerly used at Disneyland Resort in California. The Mark V Monorail modification will use 400 yards of each of two colors (800 yards total).

This scarf has been designed to be knit using the double knitting technique to produce a truly reversible scarf. Instructions and links to videos are provided in the pattern on the basics of double knitting.

This pattern was originally published as part of a fundraiser for the National Hemophilia Foundation. My son has severe hemophilia b and this organization has helped him through some very tough times in the past. Local chapters for NHF provide free educational resources for families and individuals who have all forms of bleeding disorders. They also provide financial support in the form of grants or direct donations so that members in the community can have access to the medications they need in order to control their bleeding disorder.

Since this pattern is now being offered for free, I would ask that if you enjoyed the pattern to please donate to your [local NHF chapter][1] on my behalf. Any donation is greatly appreciated by your local bleeding disorders community.

The Bardsea scarf features elegant cables in a unique, timeless design. A simple twist along the bottom, top, and side edges gives the scarf a finished look, while a staggered pattern shows off the long inner cable design. The scarf has an optional hood, which is picked up along the top edge of the scarf and worked up, then grafted together along the top center hood for a seamless effect. The hood creates an extra layer of coziness on chilly or windy days, but can be pushed down in warmer weather. The scarf itself a generous width and length and could be used as a shawl, or wrapped up snugly around the neck and secured with a decorative pin.

This is an intermediate level pattern. Knitters should have experience with following cable charts or written instructions as well as basic shaping and Kitchener Stitch technique. This pattern is sized for the average adult. The scarf is 65"" in length and 12” in width. The optional hood is 10"" high and 20"" across at the base.

The gauge is 18 stitches and 28 rows over 4” in stranded stockinette stitch, blocked.

This pattern calls for an Aran weight yarn. It works best in a wool/cotton or wool/silk blend, as the blend creates a bit of drape and softness.

You will also need a set of 32” circular needles in size US 8 or whatever size necessary to obtain gauge, and a cable needle or spare double pointed needle for the cable work.

This pattern includes complete charts as well as full written instructions for the cables, so that you may choose according to your preference.",5.0,8,20,0.0,adult one size,Aran

The Chevron Lace Wrap offers a fine fabric that’s floaty but not altogether sheer—perfect for indoor wear or ‘shoulder season.’ Arrow-like chevron panels in stockinette stitch and eyelet lace alternate for geometric simplicity in two generous sizes (even the scarf is ‘wrappy.’)

Knit in a cool plant fiber like Shibui Reed, this wrap can transcend the seasons. Reed is 100% linen, but lacks the crispness of most linen yarns thanks to its smooth, chainette construction. It’s pliable, sleek, and graceful—all qualities that emerge in the light, lovely drape of its knitted fabric.

*7th Avenue* :: A luscious scarf with texture and color play chevron stripes, using extreme opposite weight yarns to achieve contrasting densities of fabric, knit using one and two color brioche. 

This scarf is part of my Street Graffiti Collection, featuring 3 patterns all using the same brioche chevron stripes. This collection is inspired by the time I spent living in New York, and are all named for streets that are dear to me. In my heart, I am a true New Yorker. The Interior Design office where I worked for many years was in a building on 7th Avenue, near the fashion district. 

**Fabulous for last minute gifts!!** Grab 3 different colors of Super Bulky yarn, and one skein of lace weight yarn to knit this super cozy scarf!!  I used a kidsilk lace with super bulky to create a very interesting fabric.  This is a fabulous project for hand-spun and artistic yarns as well!!  

**Skill level:** Intermediate. Basic brioche skills are not required, but are recommended. Techniques used: knit, purl, brioche knit (brk), brioche purl (brp), brioche increases and decreases, using two different weight yarns together. 

**Construction Notes:** This rectangular scarf is knit flat from side to side, cast on edge to bind off edge. I originally cast this on to be a swatch, and then it just turned into the final product!  The combination of Super Bulky and Lace weight yarn makes this scarf grow quickly and creates a very interesting final fabric.  The pattern alternates between One-Color and Two-Color Brioche Stripes, while the lace pattern within causes a chevron in the center of the scarf.  The One-Color Brioche Stripes use the Lace and Super Bulky yarn held double, while the Two-Color Brioche Stripes use the Lace yarn as the Main Color, and the Super Bulky yarn as the Contrast Color. 

I wear this scarf tied in a knot loosely around my neck to add a pop of texture and warmth to any outfit. 

This pattern is both written and charted for your convenience!

A bit of simple “wrong side” lace knitting over just a few rows has a big effect here in carving the pattern more sharply; it translates especially well when knit in a smooth yarn with a bit of sheen. This project is a great introduction to a more advanced lace knitting skill—the wrong side work is quite intuitive and logical. Expand your knitting horizons and astound your fans; the small challenge required will be well worth the effort!

901894,Power Pellet Pacman Scarf,Tess Campbell,0.0,34.0,4.0,Double Knitting,800.0,"Time for a nostalgic pacman scarf! This was a super fun pattern to design. The front of the pattern shows a normal game with colored ghosts and empty space where pacman has already eaten the pac-dots. The back of the pattern features scared ghosts as if pacman just ate a power pellet. The two sides of the scarf match up so that the whole scarf creates one ""screen."" The part of the scarf that goes around the neck has colored ghosts chasing pacman on the front, and pacman chasing scared ghosts on the back.

The scarf is double knit, and the ghosts, dots and pacman are duplicate stitched. You can knit the pattern outline without doing the duplicate stitching, but it doesn't look nearly as cool. Need help with double knitting? Watch my video tutorial [here][1].

Can't knit? My channel also has a video about how to crochet a chart intended for knitting.

You will need two colors of light fingering weight yarn (about 400 yards of each color) and size 2 (2.75mm) needles. For the duplicate stitching, you will need some DMC floss (colors listed in the pattern). The finished scarf is 5” wide and 61” long, though the length can be adjusted.

Enjoy!

***Back to Giverny***  shawl is a triangular ""cousin"" to Gardens of Giverny [stole][4] and [shawl][5], which were inspired by paintings of Claude Monet. He fell in love with Giverny while looking out of a train window. He bought a house and land and set out to create the magnificent gardens he wanted to paint. Some of his most famous paintings were of his gardens in Giverny. This shawl is like his paintings — balanced brightly colored lace patches surrounded by simple garter frames. 

Asymmetrical triangular shawl is worked from side to side in a garter stitch with short row(no warps) sections of simple lace in-between. The construction of the shawl is different from their cousins, but short row sections are similarly built. Size is completely customizable, it can be a big shawl or a narrow scarf. 

Pattern available in two formats: compact (2 pages) and large print (5 pages) - instructions in larger print format ( this version is better for those who uses portable devices like tablets and e-readers; also for those knitters who have difficulties reading small font on paper)

Gauge: 20 sts x 40 rows = 4”x4” in garter stitch. The exact gauge is not important for this project. Malabrigo Sock is superwash merino, which grows significantly while wet.

Sample shawl — 80”x28”(blocked)

When I got the call that my dad was sick, I was a mess. While waiting to make travel plans to get home as soon as possible, I thought how can I help my mom through this difficult time. Knowing there would be many tough days ahead sitting around the hospital, I wanted to give her a project to distract and comfort her. ♥♥♥

It needed to be easy enough to put down and pick up, uplifting to knit and beautifully colored. I grabbed my mini skeins from my [Row One subscription][1] and started to fill in with my own scraps from previous projects. Soon I realized I had spent a whole afternoon winding off yarn and putting together two kits for us to knit together. The process was such a needed distraction.

 
Blended Love is a rectangular/parallelogram scarf or wrap knit from end to end on the bias that features the stitches from one of my favorite shawls- [Blend on the Water][2]. Relaxing slip stitches create the color transitions in this easy to knit design. 

This wrap is designed to show off your lovely little bits of yarn, whether those are cute mini skeins, funky scraps or beautiful full skeins. Each color uses less than 10 grams of fingering weight yarn. 

Blended Love can be modified wider, just add multiples of 5 sts to the repeat and don’t forget you will need more yardage for each color transition. Use any yarn, any gauge, any yardage you like - size is completely adjustable!

The pattern comes with written directions and charts so that you can choose your favorite way!


A little correction on Beginning & Ending
Row 2: slwyif, k**84**, slwyif. 


**Yarn:** You can use any yarn you like and as many colors as you wish.

**Each color uses less than 10 grams of fingering weight yarn.** 
I used 34 vibrant colorways to achieve this blended wrap.

 Sample used 34 colors

**Needles:** US 3/3.25mm circular needles
**Notions:** Stitch Markers, T-pins and blocking wires for blocking
**Gauge:** 25 stitches = 4 inches in Slip Stitch pattern on the bias and after blocking. Although gauge is not crucial for this project, it will affect the finished size and yarn requirements. A looser gauge will result in the use of more yarn.
**Finished size:** 14” x 82” after blocking.

PATTERN NOTES
This scarf is worked flat, from end to end.
It might be helpful to divide each colour into four equal balls. You can work the number of repeats as indicated or work even in each ball until the colour almost runs out, ending with a full four-row repeat.
For a wider scarf, add 9 or 18 more stitches to the cast-on number and work the 9-st repeat (indicated in brackets) in the Scarf Pattern one or two more times than indicated. Please note that this will result in a shorter scarf because you’ll work less rows.
The Scarf Pattern is both written (see Stitches Used) and charted (to the right) for your preference.

The Mo Simple Scarf—a free pattern—is effortlessly elegant looped around your neck. And it’s nice and warm, too! Knit in sublimely simple stockinette stitch, this straightforward scarf is great for beginner knitters or as soothing knitting between more complicated projects. Bring it to your knitting or reading circle if you’d like to knit and chat at the same time!

The Mo Simple Scarf is knit with one strand of Berroco Ultra Alpaca—a worsted-weight alpaca-and-wool blend—and one strand of Fleece Artist Mo—an airy, chunky-weight blend of kid mohair, wool, and nylon. Mo brings a magnificent fuzziness to the bouncy reliability of Ultra Alpaca! You just need one skein of each yarn for this simple scarf—we chose tonal colors for a gentle, marled effect.

1001456,Aspen Leaf,Michele Bernstein,0.0,9.0,2.0,Brioche Rib,560.0,"Aspen Leaf is a 2-color brioche scarf, knit flat. Butterfly wing-shaped wedges are introduced in syncopated brioche as the leaves narrow and widen. The leaves are especially glorious in a gradient main color, and a speckle or semi-solid makes a nice background. 

Two contrasting yarns in either DK weight or worsted weight yarn will make a beautiful scarf. Sample shown in Huckleberry Knits DK Gradient (Practical Tactical Brilliance) and American Dream DK (When You Said Hi, I Forgot My Dang Name).

Gauge is not critical in this stretchy fabric, but it can affect size and yardage requirements. Choose a needle size that gives you a fabric you like; you want it to be firm, but not tight. You definitely don’t want floppy; brioche rib is ribbing, and it will grow lengthwise as you wear it if it is knit too loosely!

The scarf can be as long or short as you like; my DK weight 90” long scarf is long enough to style several different ways.

1009923,Goethe,Cecelia Campochiaro,2.5,21.0,4.0,Stockinette,1800.0,"Goethe is a generous parallelogram wrap or scarf with four colors tied together by a common strand. It’s worked on the bias in silk and cotton at a gauzy gauge so it has a lot of drape. 

The yarns are Ito Gima cotton tape and Ito Kinu silk noil. They are very different textures, but the same weight. The silk noil yarn has a tweedy look that both tones down the bright cottons and ties their colors together. 

The working yardage is 900 yards.",8.0,15,16,5.0,One size / easy to adjust,Fingering
1027578,Don't Blink! (Weeping Angel- Doctor Who),Tess Campbell,5.75,34.0,4.0,double knitting,1200.0,"“Don’t blink. Don’t even blink. Put this pattern in your queue or you’re dead. It won't be fast. Slower than you can believe. But don’t turn your back, don’t look away, and definitely DO knit this scarf.”**

(*Not a direct quote.)**

Before you get put off by the two-pattern nature of this scarf, you should know that there are 3 patterns included in this purchase. One pattern for JUST the angel with its eyes covered, one pattern for JUST the angel with its eyes uncovered, and one pattern for the two sides combined- resulting in a scarf with one angel on each side, so you can flip the scarf depending on your mood.

What does this mean? It means that even if you are a relatively novice double knitter, you can still knit a scarf with one of the angels. One side will look like the scarf in the pictures, the other side will have the same exact pattern, but with inverse colors. The face will look a little...interesting on the inverse side. But these angels are supposed to be scary, right? 

The two-pattern version of the scarf should probably not be attempted if this is your first double knitting project. The pattern is a little more tricky to read, and tension is extra important. HOWEVER- if you enjoy double knitting, completing one of these patterns isn't as hard as you might think! Do it!

Also included is a chart for the ""Don't Blink"" text that can be added around the neck. It is a two-pattern chart, so that the text can be read the right way on both sides. 

Need help double knitting? My [youtube channel][1] has a video tutorial for double knitting, as well as a video for how to read a two-sided double knitting chart. You can do it!

Can't knit? The channel also has a video for how to crochet a chart intended for knitting.

You will need two colors of light fingering weight yarn (about 400 yards of each color) and size 2 (2.75mm) needles. If you do the two-pattern scarf, you will need more of the black than the grey. I wish I could give exact yard numbers, but I made this scarf in quarantine using leftovers from a pile of partially used balls....which is why I used boring colors....The finished model scarf is 5” wide and 69” long.

Can I crochet this pattern? A lot of crocheters have asked this question. Answer: sort of. You could technically use single crochet to work up the chart, but knit stitches are rectangular, and crochet stitches are square. That means that crocheting a chart intended for knitting will look stretched. However, there are a couple of crocheters that are trying it out. If they can figure out a way to make it work, I will post an update here!
Update: Just added a chart for the Don't Blink text for knitters who don't want to attempt the two-pattern thing. That chart will work if you are fine with the text just looking good on the front, but not the back. I only uploaded it with a light background and dark text, but you can just switch those colors around if you want a dark background with light text. For those trying to make up two scarves and bind them together- the chart will only work for ONE of the sides. Even if the text looks okay on the other side, when you flip the scarf over, the text will be upside down on your neck. For the second side, you will need to rotate the text chart and knit from the top down, so that the text is facing the other way.



Enjoy!

1080335,Calling All Occupants,Vincent Villapando,0.0,22.0,4.0,,800.0,"I designed this scarf to be versatile in how it is worn. The inspiration for the design derives from the work of Pierre Cardin during the late 60s and the 70s, specifically his attention to the human form and use of angles and geometric shapes. I thought, “what if a scarf is not in the shape of a rectangle, but in the shape of a ‘V’?” I was reminded of a lesson in school: when you are designing for the body, keep in mind that the form of the body is not made with straight lines. Knitting on a bias results in a drape that you can effortlessly drop over your shoulder, wear like a shawl, or even like a bandana.

NOTES
-----

**Gauge & Blocking**

* You may notice there are two gauges
  listed for this pattern. One is a
  working gauge and one is the gauge
  after blocking.  It’s very important
  to block lace knitting, so you can clearly see
  the pattern you worked so diligently
  to create. The yarn I used has quite a
  bit of silk in it, which tends to grow
  more than other fibers after blocking.
  You want to be prepared for any growth
  after blocking by making an accurate
  gauge swatch beforehand. Don’t worry
  if you can’t match my working gauge,
  but do try to match the blocked gauge!
  I would suggest that most knitters
  make a gauge swatch on a size US # 5
  to start, block it, measure it and go
  from there. You might have to knit and
  block a few swatches to find the right
  needle, but it’s worth it!

**Casting On**

* This pattern is knit lengthwise, which
  means you will be casting on a large
  number of stitches. I like to put a
  stitch marker every 20 stitches to
  make counting easier. If you are
  worried about running out of yarn for
  your cast on, try using a second ball
  of yarn for your long tail, so you
  wont run out. Once all your stitches
  have been cast on, simply cut away the
  extra ball of yarn, leaving a 4”
  strand to weave in later.

**Lace Practice**

* I recommend giving this lace pattern a
  practice before committing to the full
  amount of stitches. Cast on 47
  stitches and work rows 1-50 of the
  lace pattern in practice yarn. This
  way, you can sort out your yarn overs
  and k2togs without having to rip out
  super long rows or cast on multiple
  times.

* This lace stitch is actually much easier to remember over a long row, rather than a small swatch. If you practice first, the big wrap will seem much easier!

**Sizing & Adjustments**

* I’m a pretty tall person, so this
  length wrap might not work for you.
  Add or subtract stitches from the
  original cast on number in multiples
  of 20 to adjust the length.

* For a medium length wrap that is
  about 72” long, cast on 307 stitches
  (40 stitches less than the original
  pattern.)

* For a short wrap that is about 62”
  long, cast on 267 stitches (80
  stitches less than the original
  pattern.)

* This pattern also looks great as a
  scarf using only one skein of yarn
  instead of two!

The Molti Modi Scarf is knit flat and is fully customizable for length. While the buttons are optional, they are encouraged as that is what gives this piece its versatility. Inspired by the many ways you can don this simple scarf, ‘molti modi’ translates to ‘many ways’ in Italian.

Materials needed (in addition to needles and yarn):

* 400 yards of Category 4 (Medium) weight yarn.
* 6 buttons (.75"" diameter recommended)
* needle and thread (to sew on buttons)

***Note:*** select a yarn that has a flowy drape, low pill and soft to the touch.  Drape will allow the scarf to move more freely from form to form and since this will be worn around your neck, minimal pilling and softness is always a priority

[How to Practice Lotus Pose][1]

The Lotus symbolizes the entire practice of yoga. A lotus is rooted in mud, but it grows to bloom into a beautiful flower. The Lotus represents rebirth and spiritual enlightenment, because the life cycle of the Lotus is like no other. Its roots are latched in the mud and the flower submerges every night into river water, miraculously blooming again the next morning, sparkling and clean. The pose is a seated posture that is iconic, but practice it in a way that is comfortable for your hips and legs. It is often represented as the pose for seated meditation. 

Chakras: Lotus pose balances all chakras, as your Root Chakra grounds up to your Crown Chakra, reaching to the heavens. 

Welcome to Stacey Namaste Designs. This triangular scarf is part of my Knitting for Healing series. Trauma can be defined as “Anything that overwhelms our capacity to cope and leaves us feeling hopeless and helpless,” ~Seane Corn, Yogi and Author. This series was inspired in order to provide choice and control for the maker in size, color scheme, design, and patterning. I hope you have fun, and every time you sit to knit this pattern, you can create a new design of your choosing. For example, you can repeat lace sections or stockinette stitch sections to make this a shawl. 

This asymmetrical triangle scarf  is designed to provide the maker agency, choice, and variation - you can use any yarn, any size, any color scheme. For tips on styling, visit this site: [10 ways to style an asymmetrical shawl][2]

The photographed example is knit with Erika Knight Studio Linen, a lovely, silkey, and light 100% linen DK weight yarn. The yardage is 131 yards, and this scarf used one 50 g skein of yarn, color “Mood.” I used needles size 5. Gauge is 21 X 28 per 4 inch area. The example is 28” wide and 19” long.

Hike any trail along the Hudson River and you’ll find rock-faced walls challenging you to find the pitted hand and foot holds up to the summit. Ailm mimics the charming natural obstacle courses with repeating antler and rope cables that flow seamlessly in and out of the ribbing.*

*Covered in handsome cables, this scarf is incredibly soft and cozy, as well as light and airy. Worked from end-to-end, Ailm is fully charted and easy to memorize. An integrated I-cord edge worked at the same time results in a perfectly polished finish at bind off.*

**ABOUT THE PATTERN**

In a Mood Scarf is a create-your-own adventure style design. Within the pattern I’ve provided the instructions to work a scarf with four stitch motifs to choose from. You can work each motif as many or as few times as you’d like, and you can switch back and forth between motifs as often as you’d like.

Each time you pick up your project, you are invited to reflect on what kind of mood you’re in: do you need something mindless, something interesting, or something detailed? Allow your mood to guide you through the shawl. If you’re working with more than one color, allow your mood to choose when you need to change things up and use a different color.

The pattern includes recommended gauges for fingering and DK weight yarns; required yarn amounts for three cowl sizes in each yarn weight; and eight recommended designs (including the pattern instructions for my sample) if you’d like to follow a pattern instead of following your mood. It also includes information on yarn equivalencies if you’re interested in holding yarn together to create a heavier yarn weight.

This pattern is worked in the round as a tube and then seamed together. Learn more about the **design inspiration, knitting experience, and wearing experience** [here][4].

The pattern includes **one PDF file with both the written and the charted instructions**, but the instructions are kept separate for easy printing.

Edging is a 3-stitch i-cord, which finishes the scarf edge as you work. A center cable motif winds up the length of the scarf; one segment of the cable is split, creating the keyhole through which the other end can be fed for securing the scarf without pins or cuffs. If you don’t prefer the keyhole, the entire scarf can be knitted flat with no opening! Between the i-cord edging and central motif is a short set of simple stacked lace repeats, which is very easy to memorize. ",6.0,2,2,0.0,One size,DK

1302905,Skyrim Scarf,Megan Garland,0.0,35.0,4.0,,1000.0,"**Description**

Calling all Skyrim lovers! This scarf is inspired by all of the Skyrim holds. The front of the scarf features the nine holds of Skyrim plus the main Skyrim logo. The back of the neck features another version of the Skyrim logo, and when wrapped around your neck the logo is a prominent feature of the scarf. The back of the scarf is worked entirely in a dragon scale pattern. This scarf can be worn in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects. Even if you aren’t a big scarf wearer, this would look great hanging in a game room for decoration. 

This Skyrim-inspired scarf is a great project for intermediate to advanced knitters, but adventurous beginners are also welcome to try it out. Since the scarf is knit entirely in stranded colorwork, and because it is not a simple repeating design, it is not a “mindless knit.” With that said, if you are able to read a colorwork chart and knit in the round, then this scarf is a totally achievable project. Take it one round at a time and you’ll do fine.

I had a lot of fun designing this scarf for my husband who loves Skyrim. I hope it brings you or a Skyrim lover in your life lots of joy too.

**About the Pattern**
Coffa is a Welsh word meaning commemoration, a reminder that the ones we love never really leave us. 
Every time you put on their favorite sweater or hear their go-to karaoke song, your loved one lives on. For crafters, holding on to these fond memories might include finishing your grandma’s quilt or using up your friend’s yarn stash in a blanket. For me, creating this stitch pattern was a way to bring a bit of comfort to a friend who lost her niece to cancer. 
Shortly before she passed, Melissa had just learned to knit and was ready to take on a larger project. She bought some nice yarn with a plan to knit a hat and scarf. 
Sadly, she was unable to start the project, and her aunt didn’t want the yarn to go to waste. The collection of Coffa patterns is a tribute to Melissa and the creativity she wanted to share with the world. 
The combination of 1x1 twisted rib and the flowing diamond cable pattern make a warm and stretchy fabric. It may seem daunting to twist every stitch, but you’ll find that working through the back loop becomes rhythmic and meditative. While you may have lost a loved one, knitting this scarf will be a reminder that your lives are forever entwined.

**Yarn**
You will need approximately 454 yds (415) m/126 g of a DK weight yarn.

The language is designed for beginners. 

I designed this pattern for my beginner knitters to be used for lessons at Suncoast Yarns (Tampa FL). Printed copies of the pattern are available with purchase in store. 

I will be publishing Lori's Scarf, which is a similar pattern that makes use of additional garter ridges to help beginners learn to read knitting and to prevent curling of the stockinette fabric.

1368473,Never Look Back,Jennifer M Edwards,0.0,23.0,4.0,stockinette,1180.0,"This sport weight, rectangle wrap, features an eye-catching chevron through the middle for draping over the shoulders or forming around the neckline, which is framed by textured contrasting bands. Uplift any outfit with this striking piece.  

The easy-to-follow pattern includes picture instructions for those who may be new to carrying yarn up the side of the work. A method used during the chevron section of the wrap.

Pictures are also included for the creation of the textured stitch pattern. As well as a picture showing where to find the ""bar between the stitches"" for 3 stitches within the pattern, including m1r and m1l. 

While this may be considered an ""intermediate"" pattern. The designer has gone to great lengths to make this pattern available to the adventurous beginner who is ready to expand their skill set. 

MATERIALS
Yarn: Comfort DK by Berroco ( 50% super fine nylon/50% super fine acrylic - 1.75 oz/50g,178yds/165m) in 4 colors. As used in the sample, they are as follows: 

A: Beige - color 2703 - 520 yards
B: Forest Green - color 2762 - 250 yards
C: Navy - color 2763 - 250 yards 
D: Burgundy -  color 2760 - 160 yards   
Total Yards  = 1,180

The synthetic yarn used in the sample gives this wrap its fantastic drape and is incredibly soft against the skin. While not only being more affordable, synthetic yarn is also easy to care for, highly accessible, and safe for those who may have allergies to natural fibers. However, synthetic yarn can be a bit more difficult to block into a fixed shape once the piece is completed.  This pattern is framed on the vertical edges by garter stitch, the nature of which is to flip in towards the back of the work until blocked. At the end of the pattern are instructions for both blocking natural fiber yarn and synthetic yarn to help prevent this flip. While blocking will help, it will not completely prevent this from occurring. The wrap wears beautifully regardless. 

Needles: US 6 (4mm) needles  - The designer used 32""  (81cm) circular needles.

If using synthetic yarn and following heat blocking instructions - iron, light color towel, and heat-resistant surface.

GAUGE 
23 sts and 32 rows in stockinette on US size 6 (4mm) over 4"" (10cm) each after blocking.

7283449,Tower of Colors Scarf,Carla Cuadros,0.0,22.0,4.0,Cables & Blocks Stitch Pattern,,"Blocks of color stacked on top of each other form the intriguing Tower of Colors Scarf.

Beginning at the narrow edge, the scarf is knit in two halves, which are then grafted together at center. The stitch pattern includes simple cables, seed, stockinette and reverse stockinette stitches, which make for an easy, yet interesting knit. The pattern follows a logical progression, but it’s not quite mindless knitting, as you do need to keep track of which row you are working on. Garter stitch borders make for an all-around clean finish.

Generously sized in length and width, this design can be worn by everyone. Color choices can make it look feminine, masculine or gender neutral. The halves do not have to be identical—mix up the order of colors or go wild and stash bust by using a different color for each block. It’s up to you!

I really wanted to try an arrangement with less twisted stitch spirals that also featured a purl bump on each side of the spiral, creating an element that almost looks like a botanical vine with roots twisting upwards - and that’s how this pattern was born. 

I've named this cowl after the road I live on, and my knitting business, North Road Knits. 

This cowl coordinates with my North Road Hat and Headband patterns. I've written the pattern to be made in one size (with tips to adapt it if needed) with Super Bulky Yarn. Show in Malabrigo Rasta.

Wandering Pathways is a long, rectangular scarf with fringe adorning a scroll-like lace pattern.

""Wandering Pathways"" is a beautiful lace scarf that reminds me of long walks out in nature. With purchase of the pattern, you will receive a pattern emailed to you along with a download link upon checkout. 

It takes 2 to 3 skeins of worsted weight yarn. The sample is made with 2 skeins of worsted weight yarn.  The scarf in the photo is 73 inches long. If you are tall or like a longer scarf, I would recommend 3 skeins for added length.

I recommend a tonal or a very lightly speckled variegated color way for this project. A heavily variegated or speckled color will somewhat hide the lace pattern.

There is no need to cut and rejoin yarns during the project. When working with only one yarn, simply carry the unused yarn up the side. Twisting the yarns in the same direction each time will make for a tidy edge.

**ABOUT**
This scarf was inspired by the 2024 NY Sheep & Wool Festival (AKA Rhinebeck) logo designed by Leanne Coppola. The logo includes a sheep wearing a scarf with vertical stripes of color. I thought a fisherman rib scarf with contrasting stripes would be a fun way to create your own colors of Rhinebeck.  This pattern can be a great stash buster or excuse to shop at your LYS or wool festival. 

The scarf is knitted flat on circular or straight needles using one color. Upon the completion of knitting the scarf you have a finished scarf. You can take it one step further and add contrast colors. The contrast colors are added by using a blunt tapestry needle and weaving the colors vertically into the scarf. The number of colors you use is entirely up to you. I have indicated in the pattern how many color stripes you will have based on the size you are making. It is entirely up to you if you want to add color to all the vertical stripes or just a few. The color combinations are endless! 

This pattern is written for “Super Bulky Yarn”, but over time I hope to also include versions for other weights of yarn. 

As of February 2024 this pattern has not been test knitted.

The Vortex Scarf is a quick knit that calls for super bulky yarn. I have placed decrease stitches at each side and increase stitches in the center to create a chevron design that looks like an arrow. And because of the slanted design, one end of the scarf comes to a point and the other points inward. This pattern has two design elements: garter stitch and lace. I have also included links to my video tutorials for all the increase and decrease stitches.

**Finished Size:** 18 x 68” (46 x 172 cm) rectangular wrap.
**Yarn:** Approx. 315 yards (288 m) of MC and approx. 264 yards (241 m) of CC. Yardage may vary, see notes on yardage below and yardage chart in photos.
• Main Color (2 skeins) - JMR Studio Worsted Weight Mohair, 245 yards (225 m) per 4 oz; 78% Mohair, 13% Wool, 9% Nylon.

**Yardage:** The amount of each color used for this pattern fluctuates based on the random numbers used to determine the stitch pattern. MC uses approx. 233 to 315 yards (213 to 288m) and CC uses approx. 182 to 264 yards (166 to 241m). 99% of possible results fall within a much smaller range. The Yardage Chart shows the distribution of all potential yardage outcomes.
**Needles:** Size 8 (5 mm) straight needles, or size needed to obtain gauge. Straight needles work best with long stitches. Circular needles with a thin cord allow the long stitches to tighten and stretch, making them harder to manipulate.
**Gauge:** 12 sts x 14 rows = 4 x 4” (10 x 10 cm) square in pattern.
**Other Materials:** 10 sided die or random number generator, stitch marker, scale, tapestry needle.
  
**Generating numbers**
In my sample, I used four ten-sided dice (D10) to choose a number between 4 and 40 sts. If you don't have dice, you can use an online app like RANDOM.org to generate your numbers. If you follow [this link](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=63&min=4&max=40&col=1&base=10&format=html&rnd=new), you'll get a list of 63 integers between 4 and 40. Note: Each time you visit the link or refresh the page, the list changes. You can also just choose numbers as you knit.
There is a slight difference between different methods of picking numbers. The dice are more likely to give results in the middle of the range while the number generator will have more high and low peaks.

###**About the Pattern**

Buzz, buzz! Bees give us honey and pollinate flowers, allowing us to grow crops. They are essential for our ecosystem. The Buzzy Bees Scarf depicts these wonderful creatures with a honeycomb and bees buzzing around it. Wear this scarf to celebrate our buzzy friends!

Double knit, the scarf is fully reversible, featuring opposite color schemes on either side. Use two solid colors for a classic look or a solid paired with a variegated yarn for a more interesting color combination (gradual or subtle color changes work best).

Instructions are included for the double knitting technique. The finished size of the scarf is approximately 65 inches (165 cm) in length and 5.75 inches (14.6 cm) in width, but the length can be easily increased or decreased. The color work design is chart only, not written instructions.

**Materials**
* Size 2 US (2.75 mm) needles.
* Size 1 US (2.25 mm) needles (optional for a neater cast on edge).
* Approximately 425 yards (389 m) each of two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn.
* Needle to weave in ends.

7334681,Lillian’s Lily Pad,Kerri Williams,0.0,16.0,4.0,,800.0,"Lillian’s Lily Pad is a prayer shawl or scarf pattern that I named after my grandmother, who was affectionately called “Lily Pad.” Grandma was a knitter and crafter her entire life, and she loved sharing her skills with others. Mother to 8 and grandmother to more than 25, she had the ability to make each one feel unique and special. The shawl pattern is a simple one that resembles lily pads resting on a pond. It can be made up as a rectangular prayer shawl or scarf to brighten the day of anyone, just as grandma loved to do.

Materials: 

700 yards worsted weight yarn, 400 yards for scarf. Four skeins of Plymouth Encore Worsted for shawl. Two skeins of Cascade Yards Elysian for scarf, depending on length.

Size 9 US needle for shawl using Plymouth Yarn or US 7 needle for scarf using Cascade Yarn.

7336431,Pretty Little Thing Scarf,The Unruly Stitch,0.0,19.0,4.0,Garter Stitch,438.0,"This Pretty Little Thing scarf was designed in honor of Local Yarn Store Day.
I created  it as knitters gathered in the space of the newly opened yarn store at The Unruly Stitch, in the little town of Weston MA.
As  we all gathered to knit and exchange stories, tips, and techniques, I was inspired by the sense of unity and camaraderie among the amazing and diverse group of  knitters around me.
Our  new community of knitters was born in the last year, and our love for fiber  bound us together in the most beautiful way.
In the stitches of this little scarf, lays not just warmth, but stories told and threads of friendship as well as the promise of many more creative adventures to come.

With just a single skein of fingering yarn, this scarf features an elegant yet simple design, perfect for knitters of all skill levels.
The tassels add a touch of whimsy and the picot edging is a loving wink to the crocheters among us.

Happy Knitting to all!


There are a few border options to choose from. Some Crochet skills are required for the Picot border.

823,Brioche Scarf,Wendy Easton,4.46,14.0,4.0,bicolor brioche pattern,,"**Pattern description from *Weekend Knitting*:** ""A lot of serious knitters believed it couldn't be done - that is, brioche stitch in the round.  In fact, when I called my friend Therese Inverso to tell her about the Brioche Hat and Neck Warmer, both of which are knitted in the round, she was very suspicious.  'Even the great Elizabeth (knitting icon and in-the-round devotee Elizabeth Zimmermann [1910-1999]) didn't do brioche in the round,' she said.  But it was Elizabeth's daughter, Meg Swansen, who had introduced me to this project's designer, Wendy Easton, impressed as she was with Wendy's unique and imaginative approach to knitting.  Although they never met, Wendy considers Elizabeth a mentor, and for this project she presents three techniques based on Elizabeth's innovations: the two-strand tubular cast-on, the built-in I-cord edging, and the tubular bind-off.""

**Needles:**

The designs on this scarf and nachaq hood are inspired by the paintings of skeletons on many Yup’ik wooden utensils and boxes. The scarf is knitted back and forth with a slip- stitch selvedge; the nachaq is knitted in the round. If you want to compare working the same pattern both ways, these are excellent practice projects. The scarf, made with just one 50g ball of luxury yarn, would make an extravagant gift. The nachaq may be the perfect project to pamper yourself. (Or vice versa.)

It was a crisp, sunny January day in wine country and I was enjoying the robins when I saw a streak of blue. And then another. Bluebirds! Not the usual Scrub Jays, but real honest-to-goodness Bluebirds. It was the first time I had ever seen one in person, and I knew right then that they were a sign that things would work themselves through.

This stole, with its bird wing motif and leaves, reminds me of that day and the cool blue sky.

Long and slim, this scarf is designed to be an accessory, rather than an outdoor winter scarf. This is a pretty simple and fun project if you’re just starting out with beading projects. I’ve used the 2 different diamond motifs (beads on straight stitch and the openwork diamonds) to make the over-all effect slightly more varied. You can use a single skein of fingering weight yarn or you can pair a couple skeins of lace weight yarns, like I did on the prototype. The beads are densest at the edges of the scarf and taper off as the scarf moves up towards the neck—this keeps the weight down on the fabric and keeps there from being beads up on the neck, which might not be all that comfortable. You can use more or fewer beads depending on how much sparkle you want, or eliminate them altogether if you like.",,16,53,5.0,9 x 60 inches,Fingering

The scarf in the top photo is from the version of the pattern included in Quick + Easy Knits (from Interweave Press). The scarf in the next three photos was made for a man, and knit on #13 needles with a gauge of 3 stitches to the inch. This finished scarf measures 8 1/4"" wide and 60"" long. It took approximately 160 yards of each color.

The scarf is knit in a Seed Stitch pattern, always one of my favorite stitches because of the nubbly texture and reversible, non-curling nature of the fabric. Using two colors in this design creates a subtle striping effect, which can be further enhanced by using a variegated yarn for one of the colors.

Note that each row is worked using only one color.

This lace scarf can be knit in either light fingering weight or heavy laceweight yarn. Its two edgings feature a distinctive diamond motif enlivened by beads, while its central panel is made up of columns of yarn overs.

The scarf is worked in two pieces. First, the lower edging and body of the scarf are knit in one piece and set aside. Then a second edging is knit, and the two pieces are joined by garter stitch grafting.

The scarf takes its name from the visual impression of restless movement created by the shifting placement of decreases in the central panel.

The sample measured 8 1/2 inches x 50 inches before blocking, and 10 inches by 54 inches after blocking.

Since it’s not a specific size, the gauge is unimportant, you can use the same concept and make the scarf with a variety of yarn and needle sizes.

The pattern is super simple. Based on the same principle as Winnie Shih’s Swiss Cheese Scarf, it’s as easy as casting off and casting on stitches, but it’s a really impressive effect.

Please note that the scarf will be very curly unless you block it when it's finished.

Although Cabriole appears complex, there is only one cable stitch, and the main lace pattern is identical on each right side row.

The edging is worked at the end of each half. To make your project wider, simply add repeats to each side of the center.

Cabriole is intended for the advanced beginner to intermediate knitter.  It includes the following stitches:  knit, purl, yarn over, knit two together, slip slip knit, and cable 6 front.  Both charted and written instructions are included.

The finished size of Cabriole is up to you!  As shown, it is 76” long by 6.5” wide after blocking, or 66” long by 6.5” wide before blocking.  This is with a total of 20 repeats of the lace and cable pattern, plus edging.

*From the pattern:*

Through Ravelry, I had the good fortune to ""meet"" an incredibly gifted and generous crafter who is in the habit of spinning and knitting gifts, then sending them to lucky recipients all over the world from his home in Germany. Last year for my birthday, Jürgen sent me some gorgeous spindle spun silk in vibrant orange (he also sent me a beautiful spindle)! Enclosed was a note saying - among other things - that he wished I might design something for small amounts of laceweight yarn, as he had several 2-ounce portions of fiber, both spun and unspun, and nothing to do with them.

I thought for a long time about his request, trying to devise a versatile design that would make the most of small amounts of precious handspun. It needed to be a little out of the ordinary, and of course it needed to be lacy to maximize yardage. Finally, it all came together.

Introducing Geschenk - German for ""gift"" - a wide and shallow shawl worked from the bottom up. Based on a historic lace stitch pattern, Geschenk can accommodate many different yarns, changing its personality to suit each length and weight as a scarf or a shawl. Three different weights of yarn - all gifts to me - are presented as examples. And now: Knitty and I present to you your Geschenk; wear it in health and well being. Pass it forward.

347842,Flutter,Susanna IC,1.83,6.0,1.0,stockinette,925.0,"Flutter is worked sideways in one piece, which results in the interesting vertical striping. Easy stockinette knitted on larger needles gives this design the feel of delicate lace without a single lace stitch. The stockinette sections are combined with stripes of reversible  slip stitch color work.  These stripes are knitted on much smaller needles, which creates the overall ruffled texture.

The ruffled texture is created by the slip stitch pattern as well as the difference in the needle sizes used; change the needle size as needed for best texture - use larger needle for the main (laceweight) yarn or use smaller needle for the contrast (fingering) yarn, or both.   

This rectangular wrap can be easily customized to just about any size, from a small neckwarmer requiring only one skein of main color to a large stole. Since it is worked mostly in stockinette, this project is suitable for an advanced beginner.

This pattern is a part of **Mohair Trilogy in Four Parts** collection, available as Ravelry e-book.

Sizes:  Neckwarmer (scarf, stole)

Yarn: Lace weight yarn, approximately 270 (550, 925) yds / 247 (503, 845) m (A)
Fingering weight yarn, approximately 80 (150, 175) yds / 73 (137, 160) m (B)

I was inspired to design this scarf after noticing (and participating) in the color blocking fashion trend this past summer. I wondered how I could extend my color blocking fun into winter accessories. 

Worked in bulky or superbulky yarn with just the basic knit and purl stitches, this scarf or cowl will be a quick project for anyone looking for a simple but impressive quick gift. The pattern is also easily worked in one color yarn for an even simpler, textured scarf. And the name? “Textured Block Play” seemed too long, so I went with BlockTure. Hehehe...

This scarf and cowl make great last-minute Christmas gifts for both the men and women in your life (and it's perfect for couple scarves). Happy Knitting!

365796,the super bulky ribbed scarf for kids,heather knitz designs,1.25,,4.0,,108.0,"I went searching recently for a scarf pattern for some holiday knitting. I was disappointed in the options so I decided to create my own. There were a couple of *needs*I had to consider as I developed this pattern: the scarves are for children so they needed to be durable, they needed to be washable and I wanted them to have the look of a ‘winter and wooly’ scarf. I love the feel of the ribbing with the super bulky yarn; it adds texture and durability! It’s long enough that you can wrap it around and tie behind them for sledding… And that is how ‘the super bulky ribbed scarf for kids’ was born!

I have always loved slipped stitches over garter stitch. I love the vertical stripes it creates, and I love that it can be very easy to make something that has no wrong side and is geometric and beautiful.

This scarf pattern is something I started playing with a couple of years ago, when I first heard about [The Red Scarf Project][1], a charity project that collects handmade scarves to distribute as Valentine’s Day gifts to young people who have left the foster care system and are attending college.

The pattern includes simple instructions for making the sample scarves as shown, as well as a fill-in-the-blanks recipe version. The recipe allows you to decide how many slipped stitch columns you want and how many knit stitches separate them, so that you can create a pattern that will work in whatever gauge you would like.

These instructions begin with the procedure to make the samples; please scroll to the end for the recipe template.

It winds through the trees as it climbs to the top of the hill at Sunrise Mansion. The Carriage Trail scarf features a meandering path of stockinette stitch bordered by leafy lace and pockets of star stitch.

While in progress, the star stitch has a dense texture but it opens up to a lacier texture when blocked firmly, matching the gauge of the lace sections.

One of the cable stitches uses two cable needles. Don't be intimidated by this; it's much easier than it may seem at first glance. The cables are also small and you may want to explore trying to work the cable without a cable needle.

457440,Cloud Dragon Scarf Mystery KAL,Tania Richter,4.73,18.0,4.0,,1200.0,"Who doesn't love a snuggly double-knit dragon wrapped around their neck, protecting their wearer from the cold? Great for that post-holiday stash of yarn, the Cloud Dragon Scarf MKAL will officially start January 1st to help ring-in the new year!

The MKAL is laid out in a semi-quest format, so there will be a bit of a story involved that will be told as the clues are released!

**Contents of the MKAL**

With this MKAL, we'll be creating a scarf of draconic proportions. 

When you purchase the pattern you will receive an introductory file download of the schedule, yardage/recommended yarns, and the first ten rows of the pattern in order give everyone a taste of the pattern and to assist those who want to calculate how much yarn they would need from a different weight than fingering or to calculate their own gauge.

**Dates of Note~**

22 Dec 2013 - Clue 0 - You find some ruins... - MKAL live with introductory file - Cast on Instructions and Rows 1-11
1 Jan 2014 - Clue 1 - A dragon appears! - Rows 1-80
8 Jan 2014 - Clue 2 - The dragon rises from its slumber - Rows 81-160 
15 Jan 2014 - Clue 3 - Some clouds appear around you - Rows 161-240
22 Jan 2014 - Clue 4 - The dragon dashes into the sky - Rows 241-320
29 Jan 2014 - Clue 5 - The dragon circles before returning to earth - Rows 321-400
5 Feb 2014 - Clue 6 - The dragon's tail comes into view - Rows 401-480 

**Suggested yarn and yardage**

You will need 550-600 yards of main color (MC) and 550-600 yards of contrasting color (CC) in a fingering weight yarn. I used Malabrigo Finito, but any fingering yarn should work. This scarf would look lovely with a color-shifting yarn! 3.25 mm needles are working great for this weight of project, you could use a smaller needle if desired. Anything larger and you may run short on yarn.

Yarn yardage is given for fingering weight, however, you can make this scarf in whatever weight yarn you desire. Please keep in mind that the larger the yarn the larger the final product will be, I have a test knit in worsted weight that is nearly 13 inches across and would work well as a table runner! Worsted weight yarns will require more yarn. I would recommend knitting the test swatch to calculate how much yarn you will require for different types of yarn.

Gauge is not very important in double knitting, however, ensure that you keep a consistent tension throughout the project.

**Approximate Finished Measurements**

Knit using fingering yarn - 9.5"" x 80""

506063,Trendy DK,Jeanne Stevenson,2.67,9.0,2.0,stockinette,230.0,"I designed both this shawlette and the yarn with recent trends in mind.  Ombré!  Chevrons!  Pointy, Kerchief Scarves!  Oh My!  But then I turned it down a notch.  Because if I'm going to take the time to knit something I want it to be classic and in style long after these fads are over.  So the ombré is a slow transition from one color to another and the chevrons are subtly incorporated into the lace. The shawl is Classicly Trendy.  Or Trendy-ish.  Or inspired by the trends.  Or just TRENDY.

I designed this lace pattern based off of patterns in the book *The Vogue Knitting Stitchionary Volume 1:  Knit and Purl.*  I adapted several lace charts to create the chevron design.

The yarn was dyed by Destination Yarn with this pattern in mind.  The yarn shown is one of the Subtle Ombré colorways however any of the Souvenir (DK weight) would work well.

This pattern uses exactly one skein of the yarn.  There were only a few yards left over.  Therefore gauge is extremely important.  It was designed this way - to use exactly one skein - to make best use of the color shifting yarn.

This pattern currently only includes a chart for the lace section.  I am working on a version of the pattern with sizing options for different weights of yarn which will include written instructions as well as the chart.

I love this totem stitch and I wanted to see if I could use it in a scarf with my favorite shaping - worked from the bottom up and casting on stitches as you go to extend the width of the scarf.  I LOVE it!  

I especially love the way this yarn worked up (""Polo"" by Zitron - 60% cotton/40% Acrylic), it is nice and soft and drapey.  I highly recommend a cotton blend for this pattern.  Yarn is labeled as worsted weight but I would call it light worsted.

Please note that you will need to see how to cast on at the beginning of the row (video reference link is included).  Do not use an e-cast on at the end of the row or it will look sloppy and your edges will not look as nice.

The quick knitting pattern is gratifyingly intuitive and simple to work in two pieces with a graft at the center—or in one long piece for an asymmetrical appearance. A luxury blend with a silky sheen will highlight the curves and depth of the texture, making it a great choice for a last-minute gift.

529865,Walking Tour Scarf,Janine Bajus,4.33,32.0,4.0,stranded stockinette stitch,2200.0,"The Walking Tour Scarf is a lovely riot of color and traditional Fair Isle patterns inspired by images of native Shetland flowers: 36 shades of Jamieson's Shetland Spindrift yarn, to be exact. But don't panic: in true Fair Isle style only two colors are used in any one round. 

The scarf is knit in the round as a long tube so it will keep you warm against the harshest conditions. The geometric patterns make it suitable for a beginner, but the expert color combinations make it interesting for the most advanced knitter as well. 

This pattern offers wide scope for experimentation: use your stash, try a subdued natural-color version, replace some of the stranded areas with plain stockinette.... knitter's choice. Yarn quantities are given in yards to make substitutions easier.

Not every color requires a full ball of yarn--see below for details.

The Walking Tour Scarf starts with a simple offset corrugated hem--the rest is straightforward! 

The chart for the hem is confusing to some knitters—here is the written-out form (also found in Rev A of the pattern): 
Round 1: k2 Wren, k2 Foxglove; repeat to end of round
Round 2 & 3: k2 Wren, p2 Foxglove; repeat to end of round
Round 4: k2 Dusk, slip 2; repeat to end of round
Rounds 5 & 6: p2 Dusk, k2 Wren; repeat to end of round

Inspired by the dots and curves in Aboriginal art, the wave motif provides a great foundation for any color combo. It looks great in dark colors or brights, making it bold or subtle. 

This pattern uses stacked increases and decreases for the colorwork. This means that it is very elastic and has no strands on the wrong side. This pattern is a great intro to this colorwork technique if you have never tried it. Videos of [stacked increases][4] and [decreases][5] are available on youtube. It is also an excellent warm up pattern if you are working up to knitting [Fox Paws][1] or a [Petal Cowl][2].

569345,Arizona Sunset Scarf,Erin Harper,0.0,20.0,4.0,stockinette,1617.0,"I just moved to southern Oregon 2 years ago, and I love it here, but there are a few things I miss about my hometown of Phoenix Arizona. The main thing I long for is a view of another beautiful Arizona sunset. There’s something about the purples, pinks, oranges and blues melding into each other that makes me feel at home. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to wrap that warmth and beauty around your neck and shoulders and take it with you into the damp and cold of winter? This was my inspiration for the Arizona Sunset Infinity Scarf.

This infinity scarf is worked in the round and is essentially just a large tube of stockinette with a k2p2 rib at the beginning and end of the pattern. What makes it unique is the color work. To create a blended look, you will be working 13 stripes starting with a beautiful solid light orange color that reminds me of the Arizona sun. You will then mix the light orange with a darker orange, create a stripe of solid dark orange, mix that with a pink, work a stripe of solid pink, and so on... Until you have reached the darkest solid stripe of deep purple to represent the night sky.

Yarn Note:
**Important! Yarn is held double throughout.** This scarf only requires the yardage in one ball of each color, but you will sometimes need to use two strands of the same color simultaneously. If you have a ball winder at home, you can easily create two balls out of each color. After winding all of my balls I found that approximately 125 cranks of the ball winder will create two evenly sized balls. If you want to test yours out, just wind one ball & count how many cranks it takes, then divide that by two. I suggest putting your yarn into baggies to keep everything neat and untangled as you work.
If you do not have access to a ball winder, you can buy two balls of each color, but you will have enough yarn to easily make three scarves. Perhaps you and a friend may want to share, or you may want to make some as gifts. These scarves work up quickly and are quite easy once you get the hang of the color changes.",5.0,2,3,0.0,one size,Fingering
