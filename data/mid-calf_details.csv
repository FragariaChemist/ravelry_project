Sending you all a great big hug and all of my love. ❤️ 

Happy Knitting,

*Notes* 
This pattern is written for DK weight yarn.
But, you can also use fingering weight yarn held double to achieve this weight.
I did this when knitting up the size large to test the pattern and used approx. 110 grams of fingering weight total for a Mens US Size 10. This is a great and fun way to use up some leftover bits of yarn and have a fun marled pair of scrappy socks!
Or grab two fingering weight skeins out of your
stash and use them up. So many fun stash busting possibilities when holding fingering weight double for these socks!

*Please keep in mind that for larger feet you may use more than 100 grams of DK weight for a pair. You can also do a shorter leg (shortie socks too!) to use less yarn and have more for the foot. 
I have a video on shorties here: https://youtu.be/oBaxuAnNyyI , the same would apply to how to do them for these socks. Just whatever length cuff and leg you want. Have fun and experiment! :slightly_smiling_face:

**DETAILS**
These are the socks I cast on again and again. The DRK (DreaReneeKnits) Socks are simple enough for an adventurous first time sock knitter, and available in 11 sizes so that you can make a pair for each member of your family and all of your friends! The ribbing helps to create a perfect fit and you can keep it interesting by adding in contrasting toes, heels, color blocks or stripes. (Which makes them great stash-busters!)

**SIZES**
1 (2, 3, 4, 5)**(6, 7, 8)(9, 10, 11)**
To Fit:
Baby (Toddler, Children S, M, L)**(Women - S, M, L)(Men - S, M, L)**

**FINISHED FOOT CIRCUMFERENCE**
4.25 (5.25, 5.25, 6, 6)(6, 7, 8)[7, 8, 9]”/10.5 (13, 13, 15.5, 15.5)(15.5, 18, 20)[18, 20, 23] cm unstretched foot circumference
Recommended fit is 0.25-1”/1-2.5 cm of negative ease in circumference (when measured at the widest part of the foot).

**YARN REQUIREMENTS**
*These are just approximations. Total yarn usage will depend on the yarn you use (fiber content, ply, etc.), your personal gauge, and any modifications you may make.*

These are approx. for total yarn used per pair. Sock yarn can vary drastically from brand to brand and the amount will vary depending on foot length and if you decide to play with contrast heels, toes, stripes, etc. Thankfully, the ribbing of these socks makes them incredibly forgiving to slight variations in yarn thickness.

Fingering Weight
21 (35, 50, 56, 72)(75, 90, 108)[96, 114, 133] g

77 (127, 182, 205, 264)(272, 330, 393)[350, 415, 485] m

**SUGGESTED YARN**
*For Sample 1, I chose a merino/nylon self-striping yarn that kept the knitting really fun and also gave durability to the socks! I have worn my first pair for over a year now and they are still holding up great!*
Sample 1 (contrast toe & heel style with self striping yarn) - 
Gauge Dye Works 3-Ply Fingering: 80% superwash Merino, 20% nylon in Whiskey in a Teacup (115 g/426 yd/390 m) (multi)

*For Sample 2, I played around with mixing bases - the Sylvia Sock is super soft, with a good amount of nylon for strength and I love the playful speckles! I paired it with a soft pink on the Sojourner sock base which is more rustic and just lovely!*
Sample 2 (Stirrup Style) -
Birch Hollow Fibers Sylvia Sock (75% SW Merino/25% Nylon) in Curiosity (100 g/463 yds/424 m) (pale blue speckled)

Birch Hollow Fibers Sojourner Sock (60% Merino/30% Romney/10% Nylon) in Winter Blush (100 g/400 yds/365 m) (pale pink)

*I also knit a 3rd sample out of my own handspun and it worked out beautifully! This pattern is really perfect for using up all those goodies in your stash, or treating yourself to that one skein of precious new yarn!*

**SUGGESTED NEEDLES**
US 1/2.25 mm - 32”/80 cm circular for Magic Loop
*(Use the needle size you need to achieve gauge.)*

**NOTIONS**

This free pattern will teach you how to knit a basic sock using the Magic Loop method!

The basic sock is a work of structural knitting genius I It looks far more complicated to make than it actually is, and once you get the hang of the construction, you'll find yourself knitting more pairs than you know what to do with!
 
Plain socks (often called vanilla socks) are perfect for showcasing special skeins of yarn, and for relaxing with a mindless, soothing project that allows you to happily knit while you chat with friends, binge watch your favorite show, or read a book. 

This pattern and tutorial includes links to videos that show you exactly how to knit each part of the amazing basic sock using the Magic Loop Method.

Additionally pictures and explanations are included throughout the pattern to help you learn the addictive art of sock knitting!

**MATERIALS**
*	One skein of sock yarn (approximately 400 yards, though you will not use the entire skein!)
*	One mini skein or scrap ball of sock yarn (approximately 50 yards) for the contrasting cuff, heels, and toes
*	AUS size 1 40"" circular needle
*	A tapestry needle for weaving in ends
*	Sock blockers and wool wash for blocking (OPTIONAL)

**DETAILS**
At the top of the request list the past few years has been a DK weight version of my most popular sock pattern - [DRK Everyday Socks][3]. I decided to jazz them up by marling yarns, but this pattern works equally as well with 2 strands of fingering weight held together, or sub in a single strand of DK!

The heel gusset is on the bottom of the foot leading to a reinforced heel turn and flap. Optional glass beads emphasize the appearance of sparkling raindrops. 

Pattern requires reading both written directions and charts.

598258,My Favorite Vanilla Socks,Meaghan Schmaltz,2.66,30.0,4.0,stoc,400.0,"**The Story**
When I started out fiendishly knitting socks I hated the gusset heel. All I wanted to knit was a short row heel sock from the toe up. Having learned a gusset heel, and found one I love love love, I almost exclusively knit cuff-down socks with a gusset heel. They are my favorite TV time knitting... even when watching The Walking Dead (though nothing interrupts Game of Thrones). So here they are, My Favorite Vanilla Socks. Period.

**Materials**
* Fingering Weight Yarn; 400 yds per 100g
* US 2 (2.75mm) 32-inch circular needle (or preferred length)
* Removable stitch marker (1)
* Stitch markers (2)

**Finished Sizes**
7½ (8½, 9?) inch circumference (recommended fit: 1-inch neg. ease)

**Gauge**
30 sts and 42 rows = 4 inches stockinette in the round.

**Notes**
* These socks are worked from the cuff down, feature a modified Eye of Partridge gusset heel and use the Kitchener Stitch to close the toe.
* This pattern includes written instructions only. Make 2 socks to
complete a pair.
* Instructions are given for smallest size with additional sizes in
parentheses. When only one set of instructions is given, it applies to all sizes.
* Slip all sts purlwise unless otherwise noted.
* This pattern is written for the Magic Loop technique however any method of circular knitting may be substituted. In case of using DPNs, assume that the Front needle is synonymous with Needles 1 & 2, and that the Back needle is synonymous with Needles 3 & 4.
* **Note:** If you use a lighter-weight sock yarn, such as 462 yds/100g, I recommend going down one needle size and going up one size in the instructions. For example: I knit a 56 st size sock on US 2 needles with 400 yds/100g yarn, but knit a 64 st size sock on US 1 needles with a 462 yds/100g yarn.",,3538,869,4.8,"Finished Sizes: 7½ (8½, 9?) inch circumference",Fingering

**Are you constantly frustrated with the way newborn socks fall off your little ones' feet? Do you want a quick gift knit for the newest Newborn in your life? Are you new to sock knitting and wanting a super quick way to learn how a sock is constructed? 
These are the Perfect socks for you!**

These are our go-to baby gift knit and the pattern we usually follow for our own babies!!

This pattern only has one size. They are fairly stretchy, just be sure that your cast on edge is not too tight. We only recommend the German Twisted Cast-On for this project. We find that these fit well for at least the first month or two of a newborn's life!

We may be a bit biased, but we think our [Wooden Baby Sock Blockers][1] make these socks even more adorable! 

Yarn Requirements:
15g of sock weight/fingering weight yarn.

Pictured Samples are knit in:

Pattern Update on Nov. 17, 2016: The pattern now includes the No Pick Up Gap Closer technique variation! Find it on the last two pages of the addendum. Enjoy!

Note: For the Short SOS Version for printing, only print pages 11-13 of the pattern. 

Hi Smooth Operator Sock Knitters, 
There has been a pattern update and new info. is now included with the pattern. The pattern is completely the same with the exception of 2 pages of variation notes that have been added to the end of the pattern, pages 14 and 15. Here is the reason for the additional notes.

I’ve been tinkering around with the SOS pattern a bit and have successfully tried some new techniques. I want to share these options with you. The new notes at the end of the pattern include:

1. A simple technique tip to get rounder corners on your Kitchener Stitch heels and toes.

2. A new way to finish the heels and toes without any Kitchener Stitch. No Kitchener Stitch anywhere in the sock! I have done the last two socks with this technique and I love the look and feel of this version.

3. Instructions for another way to do the decreases on the heels and toes that creates an even smoother heel and toe decrease line. It is a single sleek line of decreases that is really quite beautiful and simple to do. This is now my go-to decrease option! Now you, too, can substitute this version right into your own Smooth Operator socks if you like.
Thank you for the support! Enjoy.

Pattern information:
Sizes included in the pattern: 
Extra-small (will fit a large child)
Small
Medium (this is the size I make for myself!)
Large (will fit men or a woman's larger size foot)

I love knitting top-down socks and I love self-striping and patterning sock yarn. I also love it when the patterning in the yarn doesn’t get broken up or rearranged on the front of the sock. This often happens when you are knitting the heel section of the sock. To avoid this problem I started exploring the afterthought heel, where the heel stitches are placed on waste yarn and saved for later. With a little variation of my own, I’ve found that this heel is a clever and perfect solution for your striping sock yarn woes.

What’s different about the Smooth Operator Socks you might ask? The pattern is written for four different sizes and includes instructions for both double-pointed needles and Magic Loop. The tutorial pattern is written in conversational style with tips and tricks along the way. The pattern includes step-by-step tutorials with photos but also has a quick read version at the end for those who don’t need the tutorial or want to have a printed version. The quick version is 3-pages long without photos. 

I have a modified twist for placing the heel waste yarn that makes it much easier to remove later. Also, I’ve never loved the look of the bars of stitches in between the decreases that run along both sides of the heel and toe. I’ve found a sleeker decrease sequence to eliminate those bars so the sock looks almost completely seamless and so smooth. I like to complete the afterthought heel before the foot of the sock is finished so taking accurate measurements for the foot length is much easier.

I hope you enjoy knitting the Smooth Operator Socks as much as I do. This is now my go-to sock for self-striping or patterning yarn although it will work for variegated, solid or tonal yarns just as well. Best of all, the fit is perfect!

**Classic Socks** for the family * 5 sizes & 3 yarn wts

This is consistently one of the best selling patterns in my line. I like to put as much into a pattern as I can so that you really get your ""moneys worth"". The sock pattern includes instructions sized for Babies through Men in 3 different yarn wts (fingering, sport & worsted) and 5 different pattern sts (plain stockinette, color socks & 3 different ribs). I work very hard to write instructions that are easy to follow. Socks can be intimidating to knit and I want knitters to have fun and be successful.

When knitting socks (or any item) make sure that you make a test gauge. Socks are knit a bit tighter than say a sweater because if socks are knit loosely they wear out quickly and they just feel awful in your shoes. Also, natural fibers work best so that your feet can breath. The first pair of socks that I ever knit were made with an acrylic blend yarn and my gauge was loose...ugh...lesson learned.

**DETAILS**
I’ve been wanting a go-to sock pattern to use with my handspun, which inspired these Curio socks! If you don’t spin yarn yourself, any color shifting or self-striping yarn would be very fun to use, and the pattern works equally as well with solids, or to use up odds & ends from previous projects!

These socks are knit from the toe up with an afterthought heel. The pattern recommends magic loop, but you can swap in double pointed needles if that feels better for you!

**This pattern includes a Bonus PDF if you want to knit your socks inside out (like my mint & pink sample)!!**

**SIZES**
1 (2, 3, 4, 5)(6, 7, 8)(9, 10, 11)
To fit: 
Baby (Toddler, Children - S, M, L)(Women - S, M, L)[Men - S, M, L]
*This pattern is gender neutral, with “Women” and “Men” only being used to signify the correlating shoe size.*

**FINISHED MEASUREMENTS**
Foot circumference: 4.5 (5.5, 5.5, 6.5, 6.5)(6.5, 7.5, 8.5)[7.5, 8.5, 9.5]”
11.5 (14, 14, 16.5, 16.5)(16.5, 19, 21.5)[19, 21.5, 24] cm 
*Recommended fit is 0-1”/0-2.5 cm of negative ease in circumference (when measured at the widest part of the foot).*

**YARN REQUIREMENTS**
*These are approx. for total yarn used per pair. Sock yarn can vary drastically from brand to brand and the amount will vary depending on foot length and if you decide to play with contrast heels, toes, stripes, etc.*
Main Color (MC) - Fingering Weight (100 g/421 yd/385 m)

**SUGGESTED YARN**
*For these socks I personally knit up 3 different pairs, trying 4 different yarns. I think any strong, fingering weight yarn would work great! The inspiration for the socks was to see how different styles of spinning my handspun would knit up, but if you are not a spinner then [Spincycle Yarns Dyed in the Wool][3] is a great substitute to create that color shifting effect! For a strong nylon/superwash blend I really enjoyed using [Purls Before Wine Robusta][4] and I think it would be great if you are gifting these socks as the care would be a bit easier for the recipient. My favorite non-superwash option is [Retrosaria Mondim][5], especially the lovely hues dyed up by [La Bien Aimée][6]!*

SAMPLE 1 (Dark Teal & Mint):
MC - La Bien Aimee Mondim - 100% Portuguese Wool (100 g/421 yd/385 m) - 1 skein Emeline (Dark Teal)
CC - Spincycle Yarns Dyed in the Wool - 100% Superwashed American Wool (50 g/200 yd/183 m) - 1 skein The Meadows (Minty greens)

SAMPLE 2 (White & Orange/Purple/Turquoise):
MC - Retrosaria Mondim - 100% Portuguese Wool (100 g/421 yd/385 m) - 1 skein Natural
CC - Handspun 

SAMPLE 3 (Mint & Pinks/Purples):
MC - Purls Before Wine Robusta 75/25 Superwash Merino/Nylon (100 g/415 yds/379 m) - 1 skein So Fresh & So Green, Green! (pale mint)
CC - Spincycle Yarns Dyed in the Wool - 100% Superwashed American Wool (50 g/200 yd/183 m) - 1 skein Cloud 9 (pinks)

**SUGGESTED NEEDLES**
Main: US 1.5/2.5 mm - 32”/80 cm circular for Magic Loop
Ribbing: US 1/2.25 mm - 32”/80 cm circular for Magic Loop
*(Use the needle size you need to achieve gauge.)*

**NOTIONS**

**Sock Construction**: Toe-up, basic gusset heel, cable patterned instep and leg, ribbed cuff 

**Sample Yarn (pictured)**: 2 (2, 3, 3) skeins of Patons ‘Kroy Socks’ 4-ply (75% superwash merino, 25% nylon, 166 yds / 152 m in 50 g), colorway Flax. Choose 300 (330, 365, 400) yds/275 (302, 334, 366) m of a heavy fingering /sport weight yarn. A rounded 3 or 4 ply yarn will make the cables stand out and provide durability.  

**Suggested Gauge:** 30 sts and 43 rounds in 4” (10 cm) of stockinette stitch on larger needles, after blocking

**Sizes:**  1 (2, 3, 4) with 7.5 (8.5, 9.5, 10.5) in / 19 (21.5, 24, 26.25) cm finished circumference. When choosing size, at least 1-1.5”/2.5-4 cm of negative ease is recommended. 

Sample is shown in size 2, knit for a US Women’s Shoe Size 7 with 9” (26 cm) foot length, 2” (5 cm) cuff. Foot, leg, and cuff can be knit to fit. Adding length will increase the yardage needed. 

**Needles & Notions:**  32 in (80 cm) circular needles in US 1/2.25mm (for sock cuff) and US 1.5/2.5mm (for sock body) for Magic Loop, or needles for preferred method, cable needle (optional*), tapestry needle, scissors. 

This pattern is written for the Magic Loop Method, knitting one sock at a time on a single circular needle. Needles are referred to as N1 and N2. Adjust the instructions to your preferred method (DPNs, 2 circulars, two at a time, etc.). 

Pattern includes tutorials for:

We are setting off this year for our very first trip to Rhinebeck and thought a kit would be a wonderful way to commemorate our first trip!

This pattern is for a cuff down sock that includes instructions for a heel flap, gusset and my favorite toe construction. 

The textured/ribbed pattern is a simple, easy to memorize, 4 row repeat that is available in 3 sizes - Small, Medium, and Large. It makes for a wonderful fitting sock!

*THE THICKSGIVING SOCKS ARE A CELEBRATION* 
of winter, of cozy twilights by the fire, the smell of woodsmoke in the air, hot drinks steaming beside an open book resting on the bedside table. 

This pattern set includes tips and tricks for working worsted socks by marling two strands of fingering weight yarn together. There are three different variations of socks to knit, including vanilla, ribbed, and cabled. Each variation has its own sizing and gauge information. I hope you enjoy knitting them as much as I did, and perhaps gifting a few pairs to loved ones (or keeping all that squishy goodness for your own cold feet!)

With just enough pattern to maintain interest and sanity, and plenty of ‘plain’ knitting to showcase the yarn, Zigzagular Socks are one viable solution to this particular dilemma.

This pattern is written top-down on DPNs, but is easily adaptable to be knit toe-up with one's preferred sock knitting method.

The Hibernal Socks are my love letter to the long, quiet nights of winter. Worked cuff down, this classic pattern is easy to memorize, and a joy to knit. I hope they bring you the same comfort they brought me!

**MATERIALS**
***Yarn***
Fingering weight yarn in the following approximate amounts: **308 (346, 379, 412, 447) yards / 282 (316, 347, 377, 409) meters**. ***I used Knit Picks Stroll Tweed in “Down Heather.” I used 1.5 balls to make the size medium with an 8” / 20 cm leg, and 9.75” / 25 cm foot.***

***Needles***
US Size 1 (2.25 mm)

***Notions***
Tapestry needle
Snips
Measuring tape

**SIZES**

****NOTE: I knit one size larger for a slightly looser, more relaxed fit (ex: The circumference of the ball of my foot corresponds to size M, but I chose to knit size L instead). If you prefer a more fitted look than what you see in the sample socks pictured in the pattern, knit your normal size. But if you prefer a slightly looser, slouchier fit, knit one size larger than normal.***

These unisex, cuff-down, mirrored socks feature an intarsia-like ribbed insert on a field of generated ‘text’ure that makes each sock unique. The insert resembles a ribbon bookmark that showcases any contrasting yarn. Picked up stitches start the dimensional tab of the bead-tipped ribbon bookmark. These socks have a gusset heel, contrasting round toe, and folded cuff. Much of the sock is knit flat and is joined together with the insert.

I call this pattern Time Traveler not just because of the colorway I used when designing it, but also because the socks knit up so fast you'll feel like someone's been messing with your time and relative dimension in space!

This toe-up sock uses simple (yet interesting) variegated ribbing and a Fleegle heel for a project that flies right off your needles and fits spectacularly. Knit it in your favorite self-striping, self-patterning, pooling, or variegated yarn.

It's great for a beginning sock knitter because the pattern requires no picking up of gusset stitches, no wrap and turn short rows, and no kitchener stitch. The foot length is completely adjustable for any size.

However, there are many, many projects with excellent notes by people who have knitted this pattern much more recently than I have, and it is extremely likely that if you search project notes and forum comments for this pattern, someone has already answered your question.

**NOTE:** The English version is only available on the Knitty website (scroll to the bottom of this page for the link). It is not available as a Ravelry PDF download.

The following translations are available via the Ravelry download link above:
German translation courtesy of [purzelonline][1].
Finnish translation courtesy of [Illusioknits][2].
French translation courtesy of [elisala][3].
Dutch translation courtesy of [hinke][4].
Danish translation courtesy of [anfromdenmark][5].

Numerous fit mods are [available on the designer's blog][6].

**From Knitty:**

Handpainted or self-striping yarns are particularly suitable for this design, as they will highlight the unusual stitch direction flow.

The use of dpns is not recommended (*designer's note: it's certainly possible to use dpns, but may be inconvenient*): since increases and decreases occur on opposite sides of the foot, frequent redistribution of stitches would be necessary. In addition, there are up to 102 stitches on the needles at one time.

Although the main portions of the foot and leg are worked on 72 stitches, because they are turned diagonally, the fit of this sock is comparable to a 60-stitch traditional sock circumference at the same gauge. Heel fit is similar to a short-row heel with mini-gussets.

Errata: 
* The first ribbing set-up row should read ""K2, \[LLinc, k2\] *to 1 stitch before COR, LLinc, k1, sl marker, k1, RLinc,* \[k2, RLinc\] to last 2 sts, k1, transfer last st to beg of round.""
* A mistake in the big toe section in the original release has been corrected on knitty.com (pink text).
* A mistake in the leg section in the original release has been corrected on knitty.com (pink text): short row pair 1 now reads ""p31"" instead of ""p32""; likewise, short row pair 2 now reads ""k31"" instead of ""k32"".

I felt the only way to achieve this mission was to design a pair of socks EVERYONE could feel successful at knitting. I realize that turning a heel and knitting a gusset aren’t the worst things in the world (and in fact, some knitters really enjoy that part) but I’ve always dreaded this and this ended up being the ONE thing that prevented me from knitting all the socks. This mock heel solved the problem.

Knit top down, with instructions written for dpns, (magic loop can be used) these scrappy socks are a complete joy to knit and even a beginner will be able to crank out a pair of socks in no time! I've also included a bonus section if you'd like to use just one color to knit these up!

Each pair of socks requires approximately 80-100 g/380-400 yds of fingering weight yarn. Using left over scraps and mini skeins works really well for this project. You can make your socks with any number of colors but for our sample, you’ll need 4 different colors.

Color 3: leg, heel, foot

**YARN REQUIREMENTS**
*These are just approximations. Total yarn usage will depend on the yarn you use (fiber content, ply, etc.), your personal gauge, and any modifications you may make. Amount will vary depending on foot length. These estimates were calculated with a women’s US size 8 foot.*

**SUGGESTED YARN**
**The Farmer's Daughter Fibers Bear Paw Sock** 70% SW Merino/20% Yak/10% Nylon (437 yards/100g) - 1 skein The Sapphire Empress

Bear Paw Sock is an amazing blend of Merino, Yak and Nylon - that creates an incredibly strong sock yarn that is also so luxurious and soft next to the skin. I love the moody colors that come from overdying this grey base.

**The Farmer's Daughter Fibers Oh Dang! Lace** 74% Suri Alpaca, 26% Silk (328 yds/50 g) - 1 skein Juniper
My favorite of the fuzzy yarns! I love a Suri Alpaca for its soft, cloud-like fiber and beautiful halo. The silk core also helps to add some strength to these cozy socks.

**Spincycle Yarns Dyed in the Wool** 100% Superwashed American Wool (approx. 50 g/200 yds) - 1 skein Mississippi Marsala
The easiest way to add interest to your knits! The slow color transitions in this yarn will keep you wanting to knit ""just one more row!"" and each item you make will be unique to itself! I love that the tight twist on this yarn adds to its durability.

I imagined Mrs. Weasley magically knitting socks for her children before they left for Hogwarts to start off the school year! She would need to make quite a few pairs of them so the pattern needed to be easy to memorize yet entertaining. The Diagon Ally Socks begin with a twisted rib cuff that flows into a broken rib pattern. After a slip stitch heel is worked, a faux cable is created with yarn overs and decreases to give a sharp contrast to the broken rib and stockinette stitch design for the top of the sock while the sole remains in stockinette stitch. The toe of the sock is continued in stockinette and closed with the Kitchener stitch.

Inspired by speckled colorways, Speckled Space Socks have an easy, textured pattern with some chevron shaping to add interest and minimal purling for speed. The pattern is written toe-up with gusset increases and a heel flap, but any heel could be substituted in, and the pattern is easily transferrable to a top-down format if that’s what you prefer.

Circumference: 7.0 (8.0, 9.0) inches
Pattern is written for 56 (64, 72) sts.

On choosing a size: Testers found that the sock fit similarly to a plain stockinette sock on the foot but that it was more snug on the leg before blocking due to the 1x1 cables. You may find it preferable to increase needle size as you transition to the leg. I tend to prefer my socks a little loose and found that a 64 st sock worked well for me without changing needle size -- I use a 64 st sock for lace/plain patterns, 72 sts for some cables, and 80 sts for extensive cabling.

For many of us, it’s the first sock we learned and our point of departure into the ever widening world of socks. While we love some of the new approaches, we return again and again to this straightforward, comfy basic. Once you understand its simple structure, improvise to your heart’s content.

If you need to size socks for a surprise, here’s a rule of thumb (‘rule of toe?’) based on averages of North American shoe sizing systems:
Women’s size 5 = 9"". For each full size, add ¼"" (e.g. size 7 = 9½"").

For men, take man’s size + 1½; the resulting number is the equivalent women’s size; using the rule above, translate this to inches (e.g. Men’s size 9½ + 1½ = women’s size 11 = 10½"").

For my original samples. I designed this sock with sock set specially mixed for this design.  Traditional sock sets will not have enough yardage for larger sizes.  Get creative!  This is a great design to eat up scraps!  Instead of one yarn held double for the MC, use two 60g+ scraps for the MC!  Have fun with the marling and make them special!

23 stitches x 32 rows in 4” of stockinette


**SIZING & YARDAGE**

Below are the estimated yardages required for every size if you stick to my suggested color distribution throughout the pattern.  The beauty of this design, is the ability for you to adapt it to the yardage you have in your scrap bin!  

If you don't have enough yardage for the MC, use two heavy scraps and hold them double as your MC instead of 1 yarn held double for the body.   

If you have a really large scrap you want to use as a contrast, use it for both CC1 and CC2 by holding your contrast double for the wide stripes and holding is with the MC for the heel, toe, cuff and middle stripe, for a “2 color” version of this sock.

In testing, yardage ranged widely depending on length and gauge.  

All sizes provided are consistent with standards set by the [Craft Yarn Council Sizing Guide for Socks][1].

Originally designed for the July 2012 Woolgirl Fairy Tale Knitting Club Kit. Now available as an individual pattern and as part of my first sock collection. The sock collection will feature four pattern released between March and May 2013. All patterns will be top-down socks and will include both charted and written instructions.

1242798,Unbearably Adorable,Renee Strouts,6.49,36.0,4.0,stockinette,512.0,"This pattern was designed for Round 5 of Sock Madness 16, and is now publicly available.

The pattern is intended for a full skein plus one mini skein of sock yarn.

This sock pattern is constructed toe-up, starting with a whirlpool toe and offset cabled heart detail. Toes are mirrored on right and left socks. The toe heart is embroidered with a strand of contrast color yarn and is inspired by nail string art. The heel is a “Keel Heel” construction, a toe-up heelflap and gusset with slipped stitch reinforcement and converging decreases. The heart pattern on the leg of the sock is achieved using the “Stacked Stitches” technique originally invented by Xandy Peters.

Sample socks are knit in Less Traveled Yarn “757 Sock”, with MC Barley and CC Hemlock.

**Sizes:** Extra Small (Small, Medium, Large), corresponding to 7(7.75, 8.75, 9.75)”/18 (20, 22, 25)cm foot circumference with ~10% negative ease and 54(63, 70, 79) sts around foot. Foot length is fully adjustable.

**Materials:**
• Size US 1/2.25 mm double point needles or circular needles for magic loop, or size needed to obtain gauge
o Stockinette gauge: 36 sts & 52 rows = 4”/10 cm
o *Due to the high tension of the stacked stitch technique, wooden needles are not recommended, as they may break.*
• Light Fingering weight yarn, approx. 290(340, 370, 420) yds/ 265(310, 340, 385)m Main Color and 60(68, 75, 92) yds/ 55(62, 69, 84)m Contrast Color
• 6 stitch markers
• Tapestry needle
• Tape measure or ruler
• Cable needle or skills to perform cables without
• Darning egg, lightbulb or other object to stabilize fabric for embroidery

**Changes from Sock Madness version:**
• Stitch map for stacked stitch rounds! Kind of like a chart for those who want to see relationships between stitches
• Large Toe errata incorporated
• LLI increase instructions changed to match the more common way of doing it
• Small Left Toe increases rearranged to make instep division cleaner
• Low Stress k3tog/k5tog alternate instructions
• Other minor tweaks for clarity

This pattern may seem a little strange. . . I like to knit with my laptop by my side. I highlight the rows as I knit, and note any changes that I make. I usually get my socks to match this way, but the patterns are also usually very long. I hope you won’t find it too inconvenient

I made these socks as toe-up/gusset heel, but the charts can easily be adapted to cuff-down. Just add your favorite cuff, heel, and toe.  Resizing for length and width should be fairly apparent, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

The Mermaid Avenue Socks incorporate a delightful stitch pattern 
that mimics the scales on a mermaid tail. Easy to memorize 
and interesting to knit, these socks can be worked up 
in a variety of yarns, from solids to tonals, speckles, and everything 
in between! 

This pattern includes tutorials for the stitches used, as well as  
YouTube videos that show how the stitches are made. At the end of the pattern, there is also a recipe page for knitting a Mermaid Fade. 

According to Mermaid lore, these sirens of the sea sometimes make their way ashore and live on land for awhile. I like to think if there are mermaids among us, they would happily wear these socks to warm their feet! 

**SIZES** 

Measurements are in inches (cm), measured around the circumference of the ball of your foot. 

**S** 7"" (17.75cm) **M** 8"" (20.25cm) **L** 9"" (23cm) **XL** 10"" (25.5cm) 

**GAUGE** 

40 sts over 4 inches in pattern, knit in the round and blocked 

**MATERIALS**

 •	One skein of sock yarn (approximately 430 yards/393 meters). You may not need to use the entire skein, depending on how long you make your socks. Please note that this stitch pattern uses a little more yarn than a standard vanilla sock!

•	US size 1 needles (36"" or longer circular for magic loop), or DPNs, or a tiny circular, depending on how you knit socks.

•	Tapestry needle for weaving in ends

IS THERE ANYTHING MORE SATISFYING THAN KNITTING LACE? 

Simple yarn overs and increases can create the most intricate, lovely, feminine fabric! 

Perhaps my favorite thing about knitting lace is how easy it is to do, and yet how complex the finished garment looks. Even beginner knitters can produce a pair of socks, a sweater, or a hat that appears to be a work of wizened knitter artistry. 

The In Bloom Sock Set features three patterns, each with detailed charts, photos, and instructions. 

The only skills you'll need are the ability to make yarn overs, simple decreases like knit two together and slip, slip, knit, and making bobbles (if you've never made a bobble before, don't worry! I include instructions for that too!).

*“The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared... several pounds of the best Turkish Delight.”
- The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, by C. S. Lewis*

Reading these words as a child, my mouth watered over this dessert I had never encountered. This toe-up sock is filled with deliciously addictive texture, creating rectangles of Turkish Delight up the instep and around the leg of the sock. A contrast color is used for the toe and heel, as well as for slip-stitch drops of magic, landing upon the snow. Luckily the enchantment of this treat will last longer than it did for Edmund, allowing a second sock to meet its match.

Once, twice, three times a cable.   This pattern was an experiment in combining cables and colorwork, with twisted stitches, two color cables, and faux cables in colorwork.  

The socks are worked cuff down starting with a double rolled cuff.  After completing the gusset, the colorwork cables become faux cables on the foot.  Charts are included to mirror the cables if desired. 

2 cable needles are necessary to work the cables on the back of the leg.

943191,August Sock KAL,Roxanne Richardson,3.99,,,,,"This is a multi-part tutorial for knitting custom fit socks from the cuff down. A new part will be uploaded approximately weekly from early July 2019 until roughly the end of August.

You can join the KAL in the Rox Rocks group https://www.ravelry.com/groups/rox-rocks

The tutorial will be taught using videos and written materials. The written materials will be uploaded in approximately one week intervals starting in early July and ending in August. The July materials give background information on sock construction and instructions on how to prepare for knitting your socks.

QR codes and video links in the written materials will link you directly to videos associated with the KAL. Some videos are “Technique Tuesday” videos focused on a specific technique or modification process. Others will be more of a discussion format, included as a section in my weekly “Casual Friday” podcast videos.

The custom fit socks in this tutorial are knit cuff down. Options and choices will abound, but the nervous novice can choose a directed approach, if desired.

Any tool/technique combination can be used (dpns; small circs; long circs with Magic Loop or two circs method; or Flexi-Flips).

You will learn sock anatomy and the vocabulary used to describe different parts of the sock.

You will learn the standard formula (and its variations) typically used to design socks, and why those formulas often fail to provide a good fit. 

You will learn how to measure your foot and leg for socks, and how to identify where the fit problems will be.

You will learn approaches for modifying the formula in order to get the correct fit.

**Common fit issues**
Leg circumference that is larger than the sock can accommodate

A difference between ankle and ball of foot measurements

Socks that are too tight at the heel diagonal

Sock toes that don't conform to the shape of your actual toes.

**Modifications and options you will have**
How to incorporate leg shaping, if needed.

A choice of three heel styles: Heel flap and gusset (with choice of heel turn), peasant heel, or short row heel. Each style of heel will have several options for further customization.

A choice of toe styles, and how to adapt your chosen toe to fit your toe shape.

**Additional techniques:**
How to plan for socks that match, particularly when using gradients and self-striping yarns.

Stretchy cast on

Ridgeless pick-up along the sides of the heel flap

Hole avoidance at the junction of the heel and instep.

Grafting options that do not require using the Kitchener stitch process.

Options for closing toes that don't require grafting at all.

However, I still need a gusset for my high instep! Hence these socks.

Pattern can be worked either toe up or cuff down (instructions included for both).

I dearly love dragon stories and have always wanted to design a pattern inspired by Kazul, and now was the right time for it.

Sized to fit a man's foot 9-11 (for a snugger fit, simply go down one needle size)

> When I asked my dad what he wanted for his birthday he simply said, ""Socks"". Given that he is terribly practical, I didn't think much on it and figured that a trip to the local sportsman's store would suffice. Exactly one week before his birthday it dawned on me: Oh my god. He meant he wanted a pair of knitted socks! With only a week to spare, and very little time to knit, I whipped up and knit these quick and simple socks.

587741,Impossible Girl Socks,Madeline Gannon,2.4,10.0,1.0,stockinette,400.0,"These socks are inspired by Clara Oswald – companion in the infamous BBC series Doctor Who.  Known as the “impossible girl,” Clara is largely a mystery to audiences, as well as the Doctor himself; but throughout her adventures with the Doctor, she never finds herself less than impeccably dressed.  These classy, whimsical socks remind me of socks Clara may wear to keep warm while traveling through planets of ice and snow, or just lounging by the fireplace in Victorian London.

This quick & easy sock pattern features two parallel mock cables running down the sides of the instep, adding a simple, yet quirky, detail to mostly vanilla socks.  Quick to learn and easy to memorize, this pattern is perfect for sock beginners or as mindless TV knitting.  (Plus, as a bonus, watching the ""cables"" add up marks your progress and makes these a very fast knit!)  The pattern also features full directions for a slipped stitch heel flap.  Happy knitting!  :)


*Errata - July 2015*
*In the previous PDF, the leg patterning instructed knitting the mock cable pattern on both sides of the sock, (front & back).  The socks could be knitted either way; however, the pattern is meant to feature mock cables only on the front side of the socks.  The pattern instructions have been updated to correct this.  (This is the only change.)*


**Notes for anyone struggling with the ""cluster"" stitch:**

 My version of the “cluster 3” is a mock-cable version. The “cluster” in my pattern is performed BEFORE the stitches are worked. You should work the pattern up to the three stitch cluster section, STOP, and perform the cluster on the next three stitches on your left needle. Go to the third stitch on your left needle, and gently lift it up and over the first two - this stitch will fall off the needle, clustering the first two stitches together. Then, with the two clustered stitches remaining on the left needle, you perform the k1, yo, k1. This will get you back to three stitches. 

(It’s easy to overthink because it’s kind of weird to be working with stitches on the left needle, but it’s very simple! No twisting or anything fancy required - just pull that third stitch up and over. As if you were binding it off backwards.)",,877,603,4.76,Medium & Large,Fingering
19774,Hedgerow Socks,Jane Cochran,2.61,32.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,400.0,"**A note about yarns from the Designer:** This pattern will work well with any hand-dyed yarn that has a subtle color scheme that's either semisolid or only discretely contrasting. Yarns that have been dyed a more dramatic combination of colors may obscure the stitch motif.  I used Sundara Yarns Somewhat Solid Sock Yarn (hand-dyed superwash two-ply Merino wool).

**Size Information:**  Because the Ribbed Stitch Pattern is stretchy and flexible, the socks can be made larger or smaller by going up or down a needle size and increasing or decreasing the length from back of heel to beginning of toe decreases.

I’ve had multiple requests for a detailed pattern to knit [My Favorite Vanilla Socks][1] pattern with counter color cuffs, heels and toes. So without further ado - here she is: My Favorite Vanilla Socks with a little extra oomph - Extranilla!

**Materials**
* Main Color: 300-400 yds Fingering Weight Yarn
* Counter Color: 125 yds Fingering Weight Yarn
* US 1½ (2.50mm) 32-inch circular needle (or preferred length; adjust needle size as necessary to match gauge)
* Removable stitch marker (1)
* Stitch markers (2)

**Notes**
* These socks are worked from the cuff down, feature a modified Eye of Partridge gusset heel and use the Kitchener Stitch to close the toe. Jogless stripe techniques are employed at the color changes to minimize the stair step effect often seen when changing colors at the end of a round.
* This pattern includes written instructions only. Make 2 socks to complete a pair.
* Instructions are given for smallest size with additional sizes in parentheses. When only one set of instructions is given, it applies to all sizes.
* Slip all sts purlwise unless otherwise noted.
* This pattern is written for the Magic Loop technique however any method of circular knitting may be substituted. In case of using DPNs, assume that the Front needle is synonymous with Needles 1 & 2, and that the Back needle is synonymous with Needles 3 & 4.

***Note:*** *Required yardage will vary based on the size of sock being knit. The yardage above assumes the largest sock circumference and a very long foot. The sample socks, knit in the medium size for a women’s size 6½ shoe, used only 80 yds of CC and 220 yds of MC. Plan accordingly!*

I’ve been knitting socks since I started knitting in 2007. Since then I’ve knit over 300 pairs of socks and I almost always go back to this specific recipe. I’ve knit socks both toe-up and cuff-down, but I’ve found to prefer toe-up. Toe-up sock knitting makes it easy to try on your socks at every stage of your knitting, and you can knit to your preferred leg length or until you run out of yarn. 
In this version, I’m going to teach you the recipe that I use when I knit toe-up socks using Magic Loop. 

**Note:** I do use the Fish Lips Kiss Heel and I highly recommend that for the heel, but I have included a Short Row heel in the instructions.

**What You’ll Need:** 
2.25mm (US 1) circular knitting needles (or size needed to get gauge), I recommend at least 32 inch (my preferred length). You can substitute DPNs and I’ll show you how in the pattern notes.
100 grams of fingering weight sock yarn. 
Stitch marker or locking stitch marker (optional).
Ruler or measuring tape
Darning needle. 

**Gauge:**
8.5 stitches/inch using 2.25mm needles.

**Sizing:** 
1 (2, 3) - which fits around a foot circumference of 7 (8, 9) inches around. 

**Important Notes:**
This pattern is written for magic loop, but can easily be changed to DPNs. Use 2 needles for N1, and another 2 for N2. ",,666,239,4.67,"1 (2, 3) - which fits around a foot circumference of 7 (8, 9) inches around. ",Fingering

**You can make a pair of toe-up socks in any size (baby to very large adult) in any weight of yarn (fingering to super-bulky**) using this simple, generic pattern. You just have to have the feet nearby to refer to, or at least be able to estimate the length of the foot from toe to front-of-ankle.

You can make these socks as a gift by comparing the recipient's shoe size against your own shoe size, and making the necessary measurements from there.

These socks are first in a series that aims to use a skein + mini set in ways that are more creative than just contrasting heels/toes. These socks were inspired by icicles and use cable motifs of irregular length.

Materials:

* Size US 1/2.25 mm needles; Gauge: 9 sts/in, 13 rounds/in over stockinette
OR 
* Size US 1.5/2.5 mm needles; Gauge: 8.5 sts/in, 11 rounds/in over stockinette
* Light fingering weight yarn, approx. 230 (240, 250) yds of Main Color, 70 (80, 92) yds of Contrast Color. Yarn used in sample socks is Long Dog Yarn *Bounce Sock* in “Silver & Gold” MC and “Golden Glow” CC
* 2 stitch markers
* Tapestry needle
* Ruler/Tape Measure
* Cable needle or skills to cable without cable needle

Sizes:

* Small (foot stitch count 54 sts)
1. For 6.5” foot circumference use US 1/2.25 mm needles
2. For 7” foot circumference use US 1.5/2.5 mm needles

* Medium (foot stitch count 60 sts)
1. For 7.5” foot circumference use US 1/2.25 mm needles
2. For 8” foot circumference use US 1.5/2.5 mm needles

* Large (foot stitch count 72 sts)
1. For 9” foot circumference use US 1/2.25 mm needles
2. For 9.5” foot circumference use US 1.5/2.5 mm needles

*If you are looking for your own typical cast-on stitch count to decide size, I recommend choosing the closest based on the foot stitch count. Extra stitches had to be added to the leg for Med and Large sizes to accommodate loss of stretch in the pattern.*

The toe uses a traditional Turkish Figure 8 Cast On, with no seam at the edge of the toes. The foot is knit in the round, in stockinette stitch.
The Heel is turned using three DPNs knit flat in short rows to maintain the striping more consistently. The number of leg sts is greater than those for the foot, and either can be easily increased or decreased at the Heel flap section for better fit, as desired.

This fun pattern is an easy one-row repeat that makes your self-striping yarn appear as a diamond shaped pattern.  Fun color play!  Easy pattern repeat, fitted sole, staggered diamond heel flap and rounded toe. 

This pattern is written for two circular needles and any self patterning or self striping yarn works well for this pattern.  The diamond pattern is really a spiral rib that has been around a long time and it just cries to be used with self-striping yarn.

I highly suggest you try the cuff on as you knit it to ensure it fits. Due to the nature of bias knitting, it may be too tight.  If the cuff is too tight, I suggest you go back to just after the 1x1 ribbing and use one needle size larger for the cuff then go back down to your usual sock needle for the 1x1 ribbing just before the heel flap.

Please note that I knit socks tightly and I concentrated on knitting with a size 1.5 needle and not knitting tightly for the cuff, but reverted back to my normal tight knitterly-ness for the remainder of the sock.

The pattern is divided into a series of four clues to be released on Nov 1, 8, 15, and 22 of 2023.  Because it is designed as a mystery, no photos of the socks are present in any of the clues and all project pages should use a spoiler shield when knitting along with the KAL.

It’s easy enough to place a textural or lace pattern on the front side of a sock only and leave the rest as stockinette where sizing is easily accomplished. It gets a bit more complicated when the pattern is placed on the back as well. Sizing can still be adjusted by altering the bordering areas (if there are any) but often such sizing alterations result in the overall appearance of the sock to be significantly different for the different sizes offered. What happens at the heel and sole of the sock is also an issue to be dealt with: how does the pattern integrate with both of those sock parts? Abruptly ending is the easiest to design and knit but is, of course, the least elegant.

> This sock design was born of a desire

> This facilitated a very organic heel

The lace pattern itself features leaf or foliar motifs that overlap on the outer edges with a column of small delicate flowers in the center picked out by judiciously placed YOs.

A pair of socks that looked like they could almost be stockings hanging on the mantle but they are cozy too. The colorwork adds that extra warmth. its a fun pattern to work, the most complicated part is the garland section because your are working with 3 colors but the rest of the sock is easy, you won't even have to look at the chart. I love that it looks like a candy cane! 

Cuff down, instructions are for magic loop. The color work is charted only. Short row heel is included but optional, insert your favorite heel. I used 3 colors for this pattern, traditional red, green and white. 

If you're a tight knitter like me, I recommend using one size larger for your size, for the colorwork portion only. In the sample I used the 2.5, for the larger size and 2.25 for the cuff and toe. 

I've included a very basic short row heel in the pattern, it's not everyones favorite, but here are links to heels I highly recommend,

When someone knit-worthy requests something, it only makes sense to oblige. That was the case with these socks – Heather’s mother wanted a cozy yet hardy basic pair of DK-weight socks. The Towanda socks are the result. They’re even named after the town where her mother grew up. Quick to knit – you’ll want to knit a pair for everyone you know (including yourself). 

The Towanda socks are knit from the toe up with a heel flap and gusset. In this pattern, all slipped stitches are worked purlwise with yarn in back.

This customizable pattern is a basic recipe to make great fitting toe-up socks for any size foot and with any weight yarn – knitting two socks at a time, using magic loop technique, and featuring a gusset and heel flap with Eye of Partridge stitch. 

I have developed an in-depth, [pictorial workshop on Aesthetic Entanglementz][1] for anyone new to sock knitting (or this construction) who wants a little more guidance!

This is not an original pattern. I combine all my favorite bits from several freely available patterns and re-write them into one, comprehensive, pattern for magic loop construction. I draw most heavily on two patterns: Barbara Tolleson’s “[Knitting Basic Toe-Up Socks Using the ‘Magic Loop’ Circular Method][2]” (scroll to the bottom of the-page) and Judy Gibson’s “[You’re Putting Me On""][3]  Socks.

This pattern makes a top-down sock with a slipped stitch heel flap and a flat toe, worked on double pointed needles. 

You can knit the leg and top of the foot either in stockinette stitch or ribbing.

This pattern is given in several stitch counts: 56, 60, 64, 68, and 72 stitches for either fingering or sport weight yarn. Socks are pretty personal, so you’ll need to find the happy medium between your yarn, needles, gauge, and leg/foot size for the best fitting socks. 

You'll need 300-400 yards of sport or fingering weight yarn, double-pointed needles in a US 1 or 2 (or the right size for your gauge) and a tapestry needle to graft (kitchener stitch) the toe closed. ",,250,117,4.82,"56, 60, 64, 68, and 72 stitches; finished size determined by gauge",Fingering

Customize the length, add stripes, add a contrast color — make them perfect for you! 

This pattern is suitable for confident beginners and intermediate knitters. New to the world of sock knitting? [Here are my top 10 tips to help you get started!][1] 

**Pattern Format:**
The Staple Sock is an interactive, made-to-measure pattern that calculates the number of stitches, rows, and yardage for a pattern. The benefit of this type of pattern is that it makes your pattern size inclusive to virtually any body size (theoretically, it should even work for an infant!) and it allows you to use any yarn and any gauge! This is done by allowing the user to type in their body’s measurements and gauge onto the pattern. Then, in the background, the pattern will calculate all the math within the pattern to fit the person perfectly. It is recommended that the pattern is accessed through Adobe Reader.

**Gauge:** 
You can use any gauge! However, it is very important that you gauge swatch and determine your gauge before working this pattern in order to determine how many sts and rows you need to work throughout this pattern to get the exact right fit.

**Yarn:**
You can use any weight and any size yarn for this pattern! However, I highly recommend using dedicated sock yarn for optimal results.

Get yarn recommendations, including budget-friendly and wool free options, in the pattern.

**Amount of yarn needed:**
The amount of yarn you need will depend on your measurements as well as how long you make your socks. However, most socks can be made with 100g or less of sock yarn. If you're making very tall socks or socks for very large feet, you may need up to 150g.

**Needles:** 
You can use any size needles for this pattern. I recommend using a needle size that creates a nice fabric with the sock yarn you’ve chosen to work with. 

Once you determine your main needle size, you will also need one set of needles a size smaller for working the folded cuff. Sizing down your needles for the cuff will help make it more fitted.

Types of needles you can use:

* 9” circular needles
* double pointed needles (DPNs)
* 36”+ circular needles to use with the magic loop method

*Please note that if you use 9” circular needles, you will also need to use either DPNs or 36”+ circular needles as we decrease for the toe.*

**Materials:**
* Stitch Markers (ideally lightbulb stitch markers) in 3 different colors
* Tapestry Needle
* Scissors
* Measuring Tape

**Techniques needed** (step-by-step instructions AND video references are included for each technique):

* Calculating math (adding, subtraction, division, and multiplication). I walk you through each step! If you are not a math fan, I also include a link to a Google Sheet that has all of the formulas ready for you. All you have to do is add your measurements and the math is done automatically!
* Stockinette in the round
* Increases and decreases
* Folding a cuff
* German short row heel
* Kitchener stitch

EVERY WARDROBE NEEDS A STAPLE PIECE IN BLACK THAT CAN BE PAIRED WITH ANYTHING, AND WORK FOR ANY OCCASION

Sweet in spring, and cozy in winter, these socks will truly be the ""little black dress"" for your feet!

Pattern includes three variations for the sock: The original version which uses a forethought heel, a version with a heel flap/gusset, and a shorty sock version. Links to video tutorials are included in the pattern, as well as charts, written instructions, and photographs.

This construction method works great for self-striping yarns, because you work most of the heel in the round. What's more, this heel construction uses the same instructions whether worked toe up or cuff down, so you can use the pattern for a complete pair of stockinette socks or plug the heel into your favorite sock pattern. Regardless of the direction you knit, you'll end up with extra reinforcement behind and under your heel.

One 100 g skein of fingering weight sock yarn will be enough for a pair of socks to fit most feet. If your feet are very long and/or wide, you may need part of a second skein.

This pattern uses the following skills and stitches:

* knitting/purling in the round
* directional lifted increases
* slipped stitches
* basic decreases (k2tog, p2tog, ssk)
* grafting of live stitches

Notions needed: three stitch markers, yarn needle

Have you been Waiting for Twilight? My *Socks of Twilight* collection releases in October, but here’s a little treat to enjoy while you wait. Worked from the top down, these DK weight socks are designed to fly off your needles. The patterning is easy to memorize, making it both fun and relaxing to knit. It’s a perfect pattern for beginners, while expert sock knitters will want to knit them with every skein of DK in their stash! The subtle blips of garter stitch create an interesting texture while still allowing the beauty of a hand-dyed yarn to shine through. This ‘Twilight Island’ colorway from Lavender Lune enchanted me from the moment I first saw it, so when she asked me to design DK weight socks, I knew just what I wanted. After all this time, I had been Waiting for Twilight.

This is a **Doodle Series Pattern**, which means it includes micro charts intended to be used as mix-and-match colorwork motifs throughout the project. This “basic doodle” uses simple, everyday motifs that can go with anything for the perfect sock!

Alright, it sounds ridiculous but hear me out – this is a fun twist on the term “potato chip knitting”, reserved for those knits that you can’t make just once, and as the first sock sample started taking shape, I found that I couldn’t stop at a single stripe, and then at a single sock, or a single pair! This is a mindlessly addicting knit (and much healthier than kettle chips), and in a self-striping yarn it knits up *fast*.

Originally, the goal for this pattern was to make the most of a 50g skein of self-striping yarn that I had in my stash - I wanted matching socks, with a heel that didn’t break the stripe sequence, and for them to be as long as possible. The best way to achieve all of this? An afterthought heel.

This heel may sound intimidating if you’ve never worked it, but it is so much easier than it may seem at first! These socks can be knit cuff-down or toe-up (I provide both directions), and they are knit for several inches without even worrying about a heel until the end, when all stitches are bound off. I provide a detailed photo tutorial for working the afterthought heel, overall it’s much easier and quicker than it may sound, so don’t let it scare you!

Here are the links to the project pages for the samples: [dark blue-green cuff][1], [light brown cuff][2], and [black cuff][3].

***

**Sizes**: finished foot circumference 6, 7, (8, 9, 10) inches, or 15.25, 17.75 (20.25, 22.75, 25.5) cm, measured around the widest part of the foot

* The sample was knit in size 8”, and for a 7.75” circumference foot (giving ~0.25” / 0.75 cm positive ease)

* Note: The afterthought heel can have a slightly snug fit compared to the heel flap method, if you are between sizes and worried about a sock that is too tight, I recommend sizing up.

**Needles**:

* Size US 1 / 2.25 mm DPNs or long circular needles for magic loop

**Yarn**: fingering weight yarn in up to three colors:

* MC: 231, 270 (308, 347, 385) yards / 211, 246 (282, 317, 352) meters

* CC1: 56, 65 (73, 81, 89) yards / 52, 59 (66, 74, 81) meters – for cuff

* CC2: 50, 56 (62, 67, 73) yards / 46, 51 (56, 62, 67) meters – for heel and toe

**Gauge**: 32 sts x 40 rows = 4” x 4” stockinette stitch, worked in the round and blocked lightly

**Notions**: stitch marker, tapestry needle

These socks are knit from the cuff down, in the round using the magic loop method. The pattern is textured, a very simple garter rib that is both easy to memorize and quick to knit. The garter ribs flows into the heel, the heel does not require any picked up stitches and hugs the heel so well.  In this pattern, I used a lovely 4 ply yarn held double with mohair for the added softness however the pattern looks just as good and is just as cozy without the mohair, especially if you use a luxury yarn like mcn. If you don't like mohair, go without it or use an alternate yarn like a suri alpaca lace.

**Yarn suggestions:** 
Medium-weight fingering yarn, and needles to get you approximate gauge. Since I was assigned lace as my technique to use, the pattern is pretty stretchy. If you're worried about the pattern being too small (as there is only one size), then adjust your yarn weight or needle size to increase gauge a little bit. 

As for color: Anything between a solid color and more subtle variegation would be good. Don't be afraid to use variegated yarn, but I would advise against variegated yarns where the colors are really, really contrasting - the pattern will get lost.

If it helps, my version is knit in Malabrigo sock in the Primavera colorway on US size 1.5 dpns. This yarn is a bit lighter than medium-weight sock yarn, and not a super stretchy yarn, but it is lovely and shows off the pattern nicely. I think if I had any around, I would have used a sock yarn with a base like Louet gems - I think that would be perfect!

1023164,Sweet Woodruff,This Handmade Life,3.26,9.0,1.0,,400.0,"A sweet mix of wavy eyelets and cables for a light spring pair of socks. I chose a lovely spring green colorway perfect for this time of year. The different greens bursting everywhere is so pretty right now.

Sweet Woodruff is an easy to memorize pattern, lots of interest and texture. I can't recommend this sock yarn enough. Filcolana arwetta is soft and yet hard wearing. Its also easy on the wallet and great colors to choose from. You can easily make a shortie version with one skein! Which would be great for summertime. 

This sock is knit from the cuff down using the magic loop method. It is adaptable to other methods. Lace and cable pattern is charted only but easy to read. I use a rounded toe for the pattern but that is optional of course. I like a cuff I can fold and that is what I did on the sample but of course that is optional too, a twisted ribbing would look equally nice. 

Size is adjustable, go up or down in needle size and if you have to increase your stitches add some purl stitches between the cables.

The gauge and needle size are just a suggestion.  Since this is a recipe, it can easily be modified to the needle/yarn combination that you like best.  One large skein of yarn (about 100g) is plenty to make a standard adult pair of socks.

Black,2.27,7.0,1.0,stockinette,306.0,"These socks were originally meant for my father-in-law – extra cozy, completely machine-washable, super soft, and a fairly quick knit for the holidays (alright, that last aspect was for me). Thanks to a miscommunication about foot sizes, I had to do a little mental sock swapping. My father-in-law received another pair (which fit much better and which he loved), and the Col. Mustard Socks went to my husband. 

I’d already made quite a start on the socks and was knitting away when we sat down to watch Clue – and all of a sudden, there was the name! These strike me as exactly the sort of dependable, simple, toasty socks that a character from one of my favorite board games and movies would love to wear. 

Knit from the top down, full of texture, stretchy through the leg and foot, and easily shortened or lengthened to fit the recipient, these were simple to knit and satisfying. And so the Colonel Mustard Socks were born – enjoy!",,383,286,4.39,men's shoe size 9-11 (but easy to shorten or lengthen as needed),DK
936306,Cuff-Down Socks,Wendy Bernard,2.81,32.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,365.0,"[Modern Daily Knitting Field Guide No. 11: Wanderlust is an essential introduction to one of knitting’s greatest pleasures: the handknit sock.][1] Nothing fussy, nothing hard—Field Guide No. 11: Wanderlust is portable joy to take with you on whatever journey you have planned.

From the master of mix-and-match design, Wendy Bernard, comes all you need to knit beautiful socks. Consider this the only book of sock patterns you’ll ever need. After making more than 100 pairs, Wendy Bernard knows a ton about the construction of socks—and she knows what we don’t need to know, as we begin our sock-making adventure. In one slim volume, she distills her deep knowledge into everything you need to know, and nothing that you don’t. 

These are sock designs that let you begin at the toe or the cuff.

Cuff-down sock patterns are the tried-and-true, traditional way to knit a sock. Choose one of three cuff patterns to start with (1 x 1 or 2 x 2 ribbed cuff or picot hemmed cuff), and knit your way down through the leg, then the short-row heel, the foot, and finally the toe, which is finished with Kitchener stitch.

You can work a pattern all over the sock, in a panel down the front, or—our favorite when the yarn is wild—a perfectly simple stockinette sock.

Especially if you're new to sock knitting, we advise you to get the lay of the land in stockinette. Once you've done a pair of socks that way, incorporating a stitch pattern from the 13 choices (allover and panel stitch patterns) in this Field Guide will be easy. 

The 13 stitch patterns are all modern, clever, and add a little zing to your sock making.

Notes

You may choose your cuff pattern from any one of three given on page 11.

You may work in stockinette stitch as written in the pattern, or use an allover pattern or a panel pattern (see pages 24-37) instead of stockinette stitch. If you choose to work a stitch pattern other than stockinette stitch, be sure to read the instructions for allover patterns on page 24 or for panel patterns on page 32 to learn how and where to make adjustments to place the pattern correctly.

One of the most unforgettable lines in the movie is repeated by this iconic character as vengeance is achieved. These top-down socks harness the indominable spirit of Inigo himself. Slip-stitches in 2 colors create the look of fabrics stitched together along the cuff and toe, while simple knits and purls become textured chevrons along the leg and instep of this sock.

After actually casting on and knitting the first sock, I decided the vertical stripes of lace and narrow columns of stockinette definitely reminded me of something…but what? And then it hit me: they looked like the racy stocking worn by the famous Cancan dancers of the Moulin Rouge night club in Paris! So I did a little research, found some historical images, finished both socks and wrote up the pattern. 

**These socks are knit from the top down. They have a standard heel flap and gusset and a wide toe. The stitch design encircles the entire leg and the top of the foot. The sole and the toe are worked in stockinette. The stitch pattern is charted AND written out. Three sizes are given: S, M and L/XL. Because the lace stitch pattern itself is quite stretchy, these socks are also very stretchy. They would be a good choice for folks that have wide feet, thick ankles, a high arch or a combination of these traits.**

The pattern is easy to memorize and fun to knit, while the broken rib stitch gives the finished pair elasticity together with a nice look. Socks are knitted from the top down with a heel flap. Both the toe and the heel are reinforced with slipped stitches.

With the stitch pattern that looks great in any kind of yarn - from solids to complex handdyed skeins, - Amaretti Socks are going to be a treat both to knit and to wear.

There are directions for stitch distribution for both the magic loop and the DPNs. 
The pattern has both the written row-by-row instructions and the charts.

Sizes available - S (M, L): sock width 7.5-8”/18.5-20cm (8-8.5”/20-21.5cm, 8.5-9”/21.5-23cm). Length is completely adjustable.

1253047,ColorRib Socks,Susan B. Anderson,2.53,8.0,1.0,stockinette stitch ,,"Good old sock knitting is always the best. What a simple, pleasant, portable project for all times. For the ColorRib Socks I created a color block look with a twist on the rib placement. Starting at the cuff, I love the look of the extended rib that goes beyond the usual length and extends slightly into the color change at the leg. Next, the little pop of color for the heel, the ribbing on the foot, and the unexpected placement of the color change for the toe, it all comes together to make a super fun sock.

The sock is worked from the cuff-down with a traditional heel flap. The pattern is written for double-pointed needles but could easily be worked on a different method like magic loop, if you prefer. 

Also, this pattern will look fantastic with any sock yarn from Barrett Wool Co. Home Fingering Weight yarn to commercial sock yarn to any hand-dyed masterpiece yarn. You could use only one color or many.

Enjoy the ColorRib Socks pattern! Make a ton of socks, give them away, keep them for yourself. Handknit socks are truly a treat to knit and to wear.

**Sizes** 
Small (medium, large)

**Finished measurement** 
7 (8, 9) -inches in circumference. 

**Selecting Your Sock Size**
The size selected should be about an inch smaller than the actual measurement at the ball of the foot. This will make the sock snug-fitting and not baggy.  

**Size example:** My foot, at the ball of the foot, measures 9-inches in circumference so I make the medium-size sock which measures 8-inches in circumference. 

**Helpful Size Notes:**
For reference, I use the medium size to fit my US women’s shoe size 7.5 feet. I wear a 38 in European sizes. 

**Other Useful Ideas:** I use the size large for men's socks to fit my sons’ US men’s shoe size 11 feet.
For sport weight socks, I use the size small instructions with a US size 2 needle to fit my feet.

**Yarn**

I've found that the feet of store-bought socks are too short and the heel doesn't line up with baby's heel.  And I firmly believe that a pair of brand-new, adorably small feet deserve a pair perfectly fitting wool socks.  Wouldn't you agree?

So I started with a newborn-sized cuff and made the foot a bit on the long side to accommodate real-life baby feet.  I paired the added length with 2x2 ribbing that goes all the way to the toe for stretch and longer wearability.

*“Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.”
- Westley, The Princess Bride*

The love between Westley and Buttercup is one for the ages. These socks begin quite simply, much like the humble start of these two lovers. Plain stockinette is worked from the toe-up, past the heel. A high contrast second color creates dimensional buttercups along the leg of the sock, easily worked with only one color at a time. The sample colors call to mind Buttercup’s iconic red dress, but this design will work with any 2 high contrast yarns. As the Impressive Clergyman reminds us, “**Tru Wuv** will fowwow you forwever so tweasure your wuv.’

It is written for magic loop and is a great intro to that method, but can easily be adapted to dpns or two circulars.

The ribbing on the leg and top of the foot allows for maximum flexibility in sizing as it can stretch to accommodate a range of ankle & foot circumferences.  It is also easy to change the stitch count to create a smaller sock such as for a child or a larger one.

*“All the waves behind them seemed to take on unusual shapes... The air grew cold. The ship seemed to move uneasily as if she felt danger behind her.” - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader*

Sailing through a storm might present a challenge, but these socks are a breeze. Worked from the toe up, the knitter will use a simple technique to create a dramatic effect. Ribbed stitches make for a cozy, flexible fit, while dropped stitches create waves within the design. The texture created is simple enough to enhance your favorite Countess Ablaze variegated yarn, but interesting enough to transform your favorite semi-solid.

These socks are worked flat in two sections, except for the cuff and toe. The heel is a no-wrap short-row heel tucked into the first section of the sock. Stitches are picked up along the edges of the first panel so the second panel can be joined as you go along – no intarsia, no seaming. Spiraling is achieved with simple increases and decreases at the beginning and end of each knit row. Directions are included for both a wedge toe and a star toe.

This pattern is written with no specific sizes but instructions are given to make this work for whatever ""magic number"" you typically use for socks.  Instructions also provided for calculating the number of stitches needed.

And my favorite kind of sock to knit is a vanilla sock knit with indie dyed self striping yarn.  So I've knit a lot of those.  In knitting so many socks, I've had a chance to cobble together my favorite techniques to make, in my opinion, the perfect sock.   Every once in a while, someone on Ravelry contacts me and asks me what I do to make my socks.  I figured that I might as well put it out here for all to enjoy.

Pattern uses the Turkish Cast On and Afterthought Heel.  I particularly love this heel because it's super easy, always looks nice, and works fabulous with stripey yarn.  However, it looks just as awesome if you use a contrasting heel yarn, so feel free to do that instead if you have a coordinating toe/heel skein.

While I primarily knit my stripey socks toe up, I've included both toe up and top down instructions. I've also got a not so Oscar winning video on how I do the Turkish Cast On [here on YouTube.][1]  
**1.23.17**I have recorded and linked a new video tutorial showing how to do the Turkish Cast On. It's much less shaky than the previous one. Hope it helps!

**Notes:** Starflight are knit from the top down, with a 1x1 ribbed cuff and a large quilt-inspired star on the front and back of the leg, with vertical lines on the sides. The socks have a flap and gusset heel, a quilted texture on the top of the foot, and a row of flying geese triangles above the toe. Some knitters find they need to go up a needle size to achieve gauge for the colourwork section. Sample is knit with contrasting yarn (yarn B) held dominant.

*I wanted the perfect socks to wear with my favorite boots! These socks hit just above the ankle, perfect for chelsea style boots. The sweet garter panel framed by honeycomb cables makes for an addictive little knit! They are my go to travel knit, and I hope you love them just as much as I do!

**Yarn:** 295 (335, 410) m/75 (85, 105) g Fingering weight
*I found that Tuku Wool knits up heavier then some of the popular, superwash sock yarns. Make sure you can achieve the intended gauge with your yarn of choice before proceeding with the pattern. Opt for heavier fringering weight yarns for the best results.*

**Suggested Yarn:** Tukuwool Fingering (195 m/50 g) - 2 (2, 3) skeins H28 Ujo (Pink sample) or H22 Valo (Yellow Sample)

**Suggested Needles:** 
Main Fabric: US 1.5 /2.5 mm – 32” / 81cm circular for Magic Loop Ribbing: US 0/2 mm – 32” / 81cm circular for Magic Loop

Adult small sizes take one skein, medium to large sizes take two skeins.
Colorway shown is King’s Cloak on Silken Purls DK Yarn available at http://www.treasuregoddess.com 

Needles/Notions:
Set of 4 Double Pointed Needles, Size US 4 (3.5 mm) OR whichever size gives you gauge
OR long circular needle in size US 4 if you use magic loop method
Darning needle to weave in ends  
One stitch marker if desired (I usually just use the cast on tail to tell me where my round began).

Gauge:
Approximately 6 stitches/inch in stockinette stitch
Gauge is not too important for this project, just know that if your gauge is significantly different, you may need additional yarn.  

Finished Size:  
Adult small to large. 7-9.5” circumference slightly stretched. This design is very stretchy and fits a wide variety of thicknesses of legs/feet. The small to large sizing will come by adjusting length of cuff or foot.

1261787,Little Sprouts in the Rain,Holly Isaac,1.88,9.0,1.0,stockinette,375.0,"This pattern is written for self-striping yarn. However, you can stripe your own yarns as well if desired. Could also be great for scraps and minis.

Pattern can be worked either toe up or cuff down. If done toe up, I think the slipped stitches look like little sprouts. If done cuff down, they look like little droplets of rain. 

This has a cute mini rolled edging at the cuff. And a fun garter stitch short row (shadow wrap) heel. 

This pattern also has my signature mini wedge gusset that is also in my [Up & Down Vanilla Swirl][1] pattern and my [Horseshoe Falls][2] pattern, which is helpful for those who have a high instep, but like a short row heel. 

6 sizes available

Easily adjustable!

I have discovered that if I use contrasting yarn (leftovers or minis or whatever) for heels, toes, and cuffs, I can usually get two pairs of adult medium sized socks out of one skein.

Pattern has not been officially tested. So if you have any questions or problems, don't hesitate to let me know.

In addition to the Knitty version which uses Shibui and Koigu, I've made several versions with [Blue Moon lightweight][11] sock yarn.  Note that the gauge for Blue Moon lightweight is larger than that of Shibui Sock, but there's an easy solution for this.  If you're using Blue Moon, and you have a medium, large or x-large foot, just follow the instructions for one size smaller than you need, and you should get a perfect fit!

1302495,Dagrun's Luggar,Roxanne Richardson,3.47,20.0,4.0,stockinette,330.0,"Fits most adult ankles and feet (8-10'' circumference) and will accommodate a heel diagonal circumference up to 13''.

**See notes at end of pattern about accommodating larger foot sizes and heel diagonals.**

For basic pattern, sizing is as follows
**Leg length:** 6''/15 cm from CO edge to beginning of heel flap.
**Heel flap length**, including decreases: 2.5''/6.3 cm.
**Total foot length:** 9.75''/24.75 cm (adjustable).
**Toe length:** 2.75''/7 cm.

**Recommended yarn:** heavy worsted weight or Aran weight yarn knit at worsted weight gauge will add durability.

I used a full skein (down to the inch) of 100g/220 yds of Kelbourne Woolens Germantown. If you're worried about having enough yarn, have a second skein on hand, or use a contrast color for the toes, particularly if  you are adjusting the leg or foot length.

This sock has a simple construction with several unusual components. The sock is knit cuff down in k2p2 ribbing. The heel is a version of the shaped common heel. The heel flap is knit in stockinette, without slipped selvedge stitches. Decreases on each side of the center heel are worked for several rows to shape the base of the heel. The turn is worked by joining the two halves of the heel stitches with a double bind off. Stitches are then picked up along the edges of the heel flap in order to return to working in the round for the foot. There is no gusset. The sock is finished with a round toe.

Instructions for these socks were created by reverse engineering a sock knit decades ago by Dagrun Skårsmoen. Dagrun was born in 1921 and lived Trøndelag, Norway until her death in 2012. Special thanks to Janne Filsrand, who generously lent me one of Dagrun's socks so that I could uncover their hidden mysteries.

From the pattern:

For the last few holidays, I’ve tried to focus on giving  handmade gifts. But, one of my biggest problems with holiday knitting is that sometimes you have to give a gift still on the needles. I like patterns that are easily memorized, but hold my attention span. I designed these socks so they have an intriguing lace repeat, and are quick to knit.

I like to think that I know my friends and family well enough to give them gifts they will enjoy, but I know that sometimes I miss the mark. Not so with these socks! My friends and family love the undulating pattern. One friend commented that they reminded her of tadpoles swimming through the water. All at once, I was picturing myself knitting by the side cool pond on a hot summer day. Not a bad daydream for the middle of winter.

If you received the pattern prior to 6pm 4/24, there is an error in the written lace chart. Please download a new copy.

THE IMBER SOCKS WERE DESIGNED USING A CLASSIC HOUNDSTOOTH PATTERN to celebrate the return of Cozy Season!

This trio will be the perfect companions on leaf-crunching walks through piles of fallen leaves, or fireside feet warmers when you settle in with a mug of hot tea and a mystery book (or
your latest WIP!).

The colorwork chart is easy to memorize, making these socks an interesting, but soothing knit. If you’re newer to colorwork knitting, keep this important tip in mind to help you achieve well-fitting socks: It’s all about tension! Keep your tension nice and loose as you carry your strands. Pull too tight, and your fabric will pucker, resulting in a sock that’s too snug. Follow this link for a colorwork tutorial:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efb2e_s3Vs8&t=235s][5]


One quick note on gauge: I am an EXTREMELY tight knitter (which is probably related to my constantworrying about everything!) I routinely get 9 sts to the inch on colorwork.  As a result, my socks often fit a little too tight! You should have no problem getting a well-fitting sock knitting your standard sock size, even if your gauge is looser than mine!

These simple socks are named Basecamp not just because they are the perfect summer camping sock (though they definitely qualify), they are also the perfect jumping off point for learning how to knit socks. When it comes to socks there are many different techniques and styles and everyone you talk to will have their own opinion on which is the best. These socks are my favorite combination of elements: toe-up socks, with a short row heel, knit using magic loop on a long circular needle. This is just one of many combinations that are available though, so use this pattern as a base for learning how to make socks and then explore all the different elements and ways you can knit them! 

People are often intimidated by socks. They think that they involve a bunch of confusing and complicated techniques, but I am here to tell you that it simply isn’t the case. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at the abbreviations section. Nothing scary or complicated in there!  Knitting socks is easy! Knitting socks that fit properly is a bit more tricky. These socks are great for beginners because of the classic rib pattern is more forgiving and makes it a bit easier to fit any foot. I have also included instructions for five different sizes and extensive size charts to help you knit socks for any and every foot in your family. All you need to know is their shoe size!


So let’s begin this fun new adventure together and explore the fun world of sock knitting.

1278985,Sprinkle Socks,Oakwood Knits,3.23,34.0,4.0,colorwork stockinette stitch,,"For these socks, I wanted to create a fun pattern that would show off colorful yarns, so that even very busy yarns could shine without being overwhelming. Both toe-up and cuff-down constructions are included, with the design customized to fit each method. The contrast color begins at either the toe or the cuff, depending on which construction method is used, and then gradually fades into the main color through the colorwork sprinkles. 

Colorwork charts plus written instructions are provided. For optimal chart reading, there are two versions - one with a light MC and a dark CC, and one with inverted colors for a dark MC and a light CC. Also included is a full page of tips on general sock making, calculating foot length, and knitting colorwork!


**Yarn ideas**
* For socks that resemble the samples, use a variegated yarn for the contrast color and a solid or tonal yarn for the main color. Choose a variegated yarn that doesn’t contain the same color as your solid, so that the sprinkle stitches don’t blend in too much. For instance, if you use a white for your solid, try to choose a variegated yarn that doesn’t contain any white areas. 
* For a bolder look, you could invert this and use a variegated yarn for the MC and a solid for the CC
* Or use two minis for each sock’s CC for a mismatched pair
* Or use two full skeins to make two pairs, reversing the MC and CC for each pair


**Construction**
For toe-up socks, the CC starts at the toe, and for cuff-down socks the CC begins at the cuff. Both styles use a shadow wrap short row heel, in which you don’t need to wrap the stitch. You can use another short row heel method if you prefer. Each construction features an optional folded cuff (instructions and demo videos are included). The cuff-down version includes options for either a single color toe or a patterned toe (shown).


**Sizes**

809669,Non-Euclidian,Sarah Jordan,2.92,36.0,4.0,stockinette stitch in the round,450.0,"> As of July 2019, this pattern now includes a cheat sheet to help you work a Non-Euclidian heel on any sock -- any stitch count (as long as it's a multiple of 4) and any gauge!

Geometry was my favorite math class in high school; the logic of it just made more sense to me than any other math I’d taken. Even today, I am strangely satisfied by geometric patterns wherever I see them. Designing knitwear has offered me a new way to use geometry and challenged me to translate two-dimensional shapes into three- dimensional objects. This heel was borne of a desire to create a shape that was somewhere between a triangle and a pyramid to hug the back of the foot.

This sock pattern features a new take on the heel. It uses lifted increases to gently form a triangle of fabric that hugs the heel. The heel turn forms a second triangle under the heel and decreases the extra stitches. Although the pattern, as written, is for a stockinette sock, it is easy to insert the heel into any patterned sock using the same stitch counts.

To knit this pattern, you need to know how to:

* work in the round (using knit and purl),
* do lifted increases,
* do standard decreases (k2tog, ssk, p2tog), and
* use Kitchener stitch to graft live stitches.

Most people will need roughly 100 g of fingering weight yarn to knit a pair of these socks; actual yarn usage will depend upon the size made and the length of the foot. If you are knitting the largest size and/or have very long feet, you may require more than 100g. Please make sure you have enough yarn to complete your project.

The Lane siblings, or rather the entire Lane family, is a family of slightly off-kilter artists in their own right and as a fellow slightly off-kilter chap myself, I designed these socks to reflect the way an artist changes the view of the world while being slightly off-kilter themselves.

The Stone Table is one of the most iconic fixtures in all of literature, and these socks use graphic lines to create an instant classic.

*“Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It’s splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.” 
– Anne Shirley, Anne of Green Gables*

Anne’s search for kindred spirits is never-ending, as she delights in the world around her and the friendships she makes. These socks are worked from the toe-up, beginning with a contrast color that is used to create Friendship Rings across the toes and around the leg. Simple cables (worked with or without a cable needle) create Little Birds of texture along the instep and front of the leg, making this a perfect design for a low-contrast speckled yarn. Work a second pair, reversing the colors, as a gift for your own Kindred Spirit.

7316254,Dragon Fairy Socks,Amanda Stephens,3.0,36.0,4.0,Stockinette Stitch,460.0,"DESIGN INSPIRATION

On the way home from school one winter afternoon, as I was finishing up the second sock for this sample, my daughter was arguing that she didn’t feel cold outside because she is a “Fire Fairy.” My 3-yo piped up and declared that he is a “Dragon Fairy,” and I thought the conversation was just the cutest thing. I was struck by how the texture on the front of these socks resembles dragon scales  and how the knitted bars highlight individual colors in the fabric like the sun glinting off of iridescent fairy wings. Thus, I decided to call these socks the “Dragon Fairy Socks.” The texture on these socks makes the pattern ideal for any yarn dyeing style, from solid to variegated and anything in between.

CONSTRUCTION

The Dragon Fairy Socks are knit cuff-down, beginning with a German Twisted Cast-On and 2x2 rib. The front of the sock features a textured panel, and the back of the sock is stockinette for speedy knitting. A traditional heel flap and gusset make for a great overall fit, and a rounded toe and Kitchener stitch finish off the sock.

PATTERN INFORMATION

*Difficulty Rating*
EASY: Project is worked in the round from the cuff down and includes an easy textured stitch and decreases. Kitchener stitch is used to finish off the toe.

Snowy Nights Socks is a lovely and simple, colorwork pattern. Snow falling in the night was inspiration for this sock design. Waking up to  a world twinkling and sparkling, frosted windowpanes and a landscape of freshly fallen snowflakes, powdery and soft. 

For this pattern you will need a main color for the background and a contrast color for your snowflakes. I might suggest using some glittery yarn for that extra twinkle in the snowflakes. 

The pattern is written with magic loop instructions but dpns are easily substituted. The colorwork is charted and the pattern includes instructions for a short row heel. ",3.5,52,179,4.87,womens M (L) 64 (72),Fingering

She wanted a pattern that had no cables; that’s fun to work up but, at the same time, mindless. And she also requested just a little bit of lace. I set to work on creating the perfect pattern for her and settled on some ribbing and eyelets to give it just a hint of “lace” but not have it be too complicated. I hope that ya’ll will agree that this checks all the boxes for a favorite sock pattern!

*“You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.”
- Inigo, The Princess Bride*

If you take one phrase from the movie, there’s a good chance that it’s ‘Inconceivable!’ These top-down socks were created in Vizzini’s image, with faux brocade around the leg and cable twists down the instep. They’re easier than they appear, though, with only one color worked at a time throughout the design, and no cable needle necessary. You might even call it ‘inconceivable!’ how deceivingly easy they are to knit. Enjoy this design and remember: never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!

Learn how to do magic loop, 2 circulars or 9"" circs!

Knit socks are a staple for many knitters. If you are working on your first or 100th pair I am sure that you will have fun and will learn some things along the way.

Crochet socks are a delicate dance of getting the structure of the sock without the bulk of crochet. Let’s learn from the best and stitch up the beautiful pattern from Rohn.

The Spoondrift Socks are anklets knit from the cuff down, using the magic loop technique, however dpns can be easily substituted. The pattern is easily memorized, a bit of texture and lace. The pattern is both charted and written chart instructions. I used one skein of Brooklyn Tweed Peerie with just a few grams left over, depending on your foot length, you may need more than one skein.

This pattern comes with instructions for two ornament styles: a very fluffy and full stockinette mohair two-tiered ruffle, and a doll like simple lace and picot edge two-tiered cufflet.

Tag me on Instagram @JamesNWatts and use the hashtag #GrannysAtticSocks. 

If fancy ruffley socks aren't your thing, this also makes a perfectly good vanilla sock pattern, as the ruffles are added after completing the sock. Conversely you can absolutely take a hand knit sock you already made from a different pattern and retroactively add ruffles or lace to it with this pattern! Too neat.

**YARN**
Mohair version-
For the sock: Ritual Dyes Maiden, 100g, 400yds (*365m*), 80% superwash merino, 20% nylon in the colorway Lithodora

For the mohair ruffles: Ritual Dyes Fae, 50g, 459yds (*419m*), 72% kid mohair, 28% silk in the colorway Lithodora

Lace Version-
Patons Kroy Socks, 50g, 166yds (*152m*), 75% washable wool, 25% nylon in the colorway Muslin

**SIZING**
Toddler(Child, Youth 6-9, Youth 10-13) (Adult S, Adult M, Adult L)
To fit a foot circumference of:
5.5(6, 6.5, 7) (8, 9, 10)” / *14(15, 16.5, 18) (20.5, 23, 25.5)cm*
Sock is meant to be worn with 1-2”/*2.5-5cm* negative ease around the foot. 

Finished sock has a circumference of: 
4.5(5.25, 5.75, 6.25) (6.75, 8, 9.25)” / *11.5(13.5, 14.5, 16) (17, 20.5, 23.5)cm* 

Size up or down for a tighter or looser fit depending on your preference.


**GAUGE**
28sts x 40 rows = 4” / 10cm in stockinette stitch on size 0 (2mm) knitting needles or any size needle needed to get gauge. 
In this pattern, stitch gauge is much more important than row gauge. All vertical measurements are provided in inches/cm rather than row counts, so prioritize stitch gauge.

**YARDAGE**
Mohair Version-
For the sock, you will need:
70(95, 120, 149) (171, 214, 252) yards 
64(87, 110, 136) (156, 196, 230) meters
For the mohair ruffles you will need:
33(38, 52, 58) (69, 81, 92) yards
30(35, 48, 53) (63, 74, 84) meters

Lace Version-
The lace version uses one yarn for both the sock and the lace cufflets, the total yardage is provided below:
112(144, 187, 224) (261, 320, 375) yards
102(132, 171, 205) (239, 293, 343) meters


**NEEDLES AND NOTIONS**
•	Size 0 (2mm) knitting needles, or any size that you meet gauge with. You can use long circular needles (24” +) for magic loop, short circular needles (9” -) for standard knitting in the round, or DPNs. Magic loop is always my preference.
•	For the mohair version: Size 4 (3.5mm) knitting needles, or a needle 4 sizes larger than the needle you used to knit the body of your sock. Use any needle style you prefer for knitting in the round.
•	For the lace version: Size 6 (4.0mm) knitting needles, or a needle 6 sizes larger than the needle you used to knit the body of your sock. Use any needle style you prefer for knitting in the round.

**CONSTRUCTION**
This sock is knitted top down, in the round. The heel is constructed using German short rows. The toe is grafted with Kitchener stitch. Both the stockinette ruffle and lace cufflet start by picking up stitches around the circumference of the sock. The lace version uses a picot bind off. Tutorial videos for picking up stitches, knitting a picot bind off, and German short row heel are included.

There are many different methods for knitting socks, and many experienced sock knitters have strong opinions about what works best for them. The sock pattern here is just one type of sock construction and serves as a vehicle for the fun ornaments which are applied to the finished sock. If you are an experienced sock knitter and have strong preferences about gauge, type of cast on, stitch count, heel construction, top-down vs bottom-up, then please knit your sock how you like. I’d advise that you follow the instructions for the length of the leg before beginning the heel, otherwise knit how you like, then follow the instructions for the ornaments.

Speed Bumps is the second design in a four part sock series that will work perfectly with self-striping sock yarn. This design is a simple repeat using knits and purls that is excellent for the first time sock knitter. Or the knitter looking for a pattern that looks great with stripes.

***“Every sunset brings the promise of a new dawn.”
- Ralph Waldo Emerson***

Each new day brings the promise of fresh adventures and unexpected surprises, and these socks are the latest adventure for your needles. Worked from the top-down, this is the fingering weight version of my ‘Waiting For Twilight’ DK socks design. Knit with fingering weight sock yarn, this pair wears wonderfully as everyday socks. The simple patterning is easy to memorize and is a great way to highlight a speckled or variegated yarn. Take time to enjoy the moment, even when you are Chasing Dawn.

Additionally, there is a guide to modifications described in this [pdf document][2] and in this [blog post][3].

For a video about doing the special twist stitch, see <a href=""http://allbuttonedup.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/9-to-5-socks-pattern-support/"">this post </a>on my blog.<br />

<br />
These socks feature a deceptively simple stitch pattern that looks like it would require a cable needle; but it doesn't! The heel uses a half-linen stitch that creates a woven look that perfectly compliments the two spirals that continue down each side of the heel flap. This sock also features a special method of picking up the heel stitches in a way which places the column of selvedge stitches on the outside of the sock, creating a decorative braid that further sets off the heel. This sock is very stretchy because of the ribbed nature of the stitch pattern.

The socks are really warm, as they are knitted with two strands of yarn. They were specially designed for long cozy evenings, when extra warmth is so much appreciated. 
The socks are knitted from the top down with a fish lips kiss heel. Decreases are added at the transition to the ankle for a more comfortable fit.

There are directions for stitch distribution both for the magic loop and for DPNs.
Pattern contains slightly different instructions for the right and left sock at the heel part. This places the transition column of fair isle stitches at the beginning of each round on the inner side of legs.

These cozy boot socks are quick to whip up and warm and wonderful to wear. Knit in Pishkun, a rustic heavy-DK from The Farmer’s Daughter Fibers, they are written for 7 sizes, from 6.5-11” [16.5-28 cm] circumference and adjustable to any foot length.  You can also substitute a superwash DK like Juicy DK if you prefer, just make sure to check your gauge! 

These socks are designed to harness the warm and loving spirit of the knitting community. I came up with this project in conjunction with my friend Candice, the creative force behind The Farmer’s Daughter Fibers. She has created an amazing initiative called Sisters United which supports Native American women. In Candice’s words:

> *Sisters United is a community based initiative supported by fellow makers
> to raise money to support
> organizations that are dedicated to
> support Native American Women. Due to
> trans generational trauma, cultural
> genocide, and colonization, Native
> women are one of the most at risk
> minorities in the United States for
> domestic violence, rape, murder, human
> trafficking, health related problems,
> suicide, and drug abuse. We believe
> that a spark of change in a community
> begins with strong women and positive
> family foundations. Our goal is to
> bring a small offering of financial
> substance to programs who support
> Native Women, Youth, and Communities.
> We also pledge to do the ground work
> for these issues, including bringing
> education and awareness on our
> platforms and working with local Human
> Trafficking and MMIW task force.*

I have been honored to work with Candice regularly since the very beginning of Boyland Knitworks, and through our work together we have developed a wonderful friendship. When she created this initiative I knew I wanted to contribute somehow, so I designed these socks to be warm, cozy and fun and quick to knit. Nothing is more comforting than a pair of handknit socks, in my opinion, especially when they are knit in a thicker weight yarn like Pishkun. Sisters United Socks are perfect as boot socks or for just lounging around the house on chilly winter days.

Sisters United Socks will be available to purchase at [https://sistersunitedmt.org/][3] on Tuesday, 10/22.  My hope is that knitters will choose to knit these socks and send a pair (or several pairs) to The Farmer’s Daughter Fibers to be included in Sisters United Healing Bundles that are be distributed to Indigenous women in need. You can learn more about the Healing Bundles [here][4].

Edited to add: These socks fit my US shoe size 7.5 and average size ankle and leg. If your socks are too tight go up a needle size or two or add some stitches to the cast on number:)

First off, 250-300 yards of ANY worsted weight yarn will do - Cascade 220, Quince & Co. Lark, Madtosh Worsted, Lorna's Laces..... any worsted weight. I prefer wool and it could be superwash or not ~ it's up to you!

I am back with a companion pattern for the ""How I Make My Socks"" recipe that is found on my blog.

Here is the Rav project page link for ""[How I Make My Socks][1]""

The blog post connected to this pattern provides the numbers to make the same socks using a worsted/aran weight yarn. 

The worsted weight version is a companion to the original sock pattern which is [found on my blog][2].

You will need to simply plug in the numbers for the worsted weight version. The worsted weight socks are made exactly the same way as the original fingering weight socks only with the new numbers.

Have fun with your squishy new worsted weight socks!

Even if you’re already an accomplished sock heel knitter, you’ll appreciate the ease of this heel. It’s perfect for gift knitting because you won’t need exact sizes, the method is quicker, and the yarn used is a heavier weight.  A bonus is that this pattern is perfect for using those beautiful self-striping sock yarns because your stripe sequence will never be interrupted at the heel again.

* The details in this pattern will restrict the fabric more than plain stockinette stitch. Based on the experience of testers, I do not recommend that you size down or use smaller needles – even if you tend to be a slightly looser knitter. One tester who usually has to go down in either needle size or sock size (or both) said she achieved the best fit by knitting her actual sock size and using the recommended needles on this project. If you tend to be a tight knitter, please keep an eye on your gauge and adjust as needed.

95742,Spider Socks,Terri Knight,4.14,9.0,,stockinette,,"Many thanks to Barbara Walker’s original, creative idea of the large spider pattern. Thanks also go out to the late Chewyknits for her help in getting this pattern together many years ago and for allowing me to add her large spider chart from ""The Gardener"" to my pattern. It is very sad that Leslie is no longer with us, but we can honor her by knitting her socks patterns too.

Added 3/7/21 - If you want to use her spider chart instead of my written instructions, it will represent the front of the leg on my sock. Her Round 2 on the chart equals Needle 1 of Round 6 on my written pattern. Her chart will need to be flanked by 2 stitches on each side to match my written pattern for Needle 1 (p1, k1, her chart, k1, p1).

Please also note the errata listed below for her chart and make changes to your printed copy.  I cannot correct the error on her chart for you, sorry. I am not going to create a new corrected chart.

I hope this answers your questions. It has been a very long time since I wrote this pattern and I ask that you have patience in getting an answer- I have to reacquaint myself with it when there is a question.

5/13/20  Here you will find a lovely pair of fingerless gloves to knit. The pattern is in Russian, but her charts are great....and perhaps she has a better way of creating little spiders. https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/mittens-spiders


Errata added 9/7/09:
Wollgeschnatter has brought it to my attention that there are a couple of little mistakes within the big spider chart included with my pattern:
-In the middle of row 17 there’s a knit stitch missing before and after the “M”s. 
-In row 19 there’s a wrong sign (compared to the written instruction there should be the sign for “Left Twist, purl bg” instead of a simple “left twist”). Reading right to left Row 19 of the Spider Chart should start with ""*purl 3, Left Twist, purl bg* TWICE""",,660,1683,4.5,variable,Fingering

The Amberwing Socks began as an adventure into the delightful world of traditional Estonian inlay knitting, known as Roosimine. 

This centuries-old technique involves creating both simple and complex designs with strands of yarn, resulting in a unique fabric that resembles embroidery. Of course I wanted to apply this technique to socks, and was smitten with the result! I designed a simple parade of dragonflies floating down the side of the sock - something simple enough that Roosimine beginners could easily learn! The addition of the traditional Latvian braid adds a special touch to the cuff, resulting in a sock that looks quite fancy, but is simple to craft!

The pattern includes full tutorials for both the Latvian Braid and Estonian Inlay! Additionally, links to video tutorials are included so you can watch me demonstrate both techniques!

There are 2 versions of socks to knit in this pattern. The lacy anklets are very pretty and take no time at all. The lace is intuitive, don't let it intimidate you.

The pattern is written for circular needles knitting magic loop style but easy to adapt if you prefer dpns. The socks are knit from the cuff down and the lace is charted only.

**From Pattern Introduction** These interesting socks are named after a town in Gwynedd, the medieval kingdom of Owain Glyndwr, in Northern Wales.  Walking along the old city wall with a view to the sea, I could imagine the dramatic history that had passed this way.  Wales, especially, Gwynedd, has a long tradition of sock knitting.  The women would knit socks by the fireside and walk miles to sell their wares in the market towns.  Time spent trekking through the hills nearby, visiting castles with towers and dungeons, viewing the landscape from the heights of Mt. Snowden, and coming upon a small woolen mill or two, made visiting this country very special.

Baby socks that hold snug to tiny feet and look adorable worn long or cuffed. 

This is a perfect project for leftover sock yarn or a lovely 20g mini skein, a pair of these sweet socks uses only 12-15g.

If you are new to sock knitting or just want some tips on perfecting the finer details, you are welcome to view the whole step-by-step tutorial version of this pattern on my website.  I've included some of my common tricks for knitting perfect socks of all sizes.

***Technique***
MagicLoop is my favorite method for sock knitting and instructions are written for that technique.  Feel free to use DPN needles if that is your preference.

***Sizing***
This pattern is ***free*** as it only includes one size, which depending on the little one's feet size could fit newborn to 6 months or up to a year.  For a larger foot or if the tiny one is growing quickly, I recommend knitting per the pattern instructions but with a 2.5mm (US 1.5) or 2.75mm (US 2) needle and consider adding a few rows for the length of the foot.

1362115,Inizio Socks,New York Year,2.0,36.0,4.0,,350.0,"Inizio means ""beginning"" in Italian, and this basic ribbed sock pattern is the perfect place start if you are an adventurous beginner sock knitter. This has been my go-to sock recipe for years, and the sock pattern that I want to cast on again and again. The ribbing helps create the perfect fit, and the heel flap will fit snugly against your foot. The Inizio Sock pattern comes with three different textures to choose from for the heel flap (it's like getting three patterns in one!), and will give you the chance to add a fun texture into the mix. The pattern is easily customizable, so you can add contrasting cuffs, heels, toes, blocks of colors or stripes!

The Inizio Socks are knit cuff-down, in the round, with a heel flap and gusset. The pattern only includes written instructions. This pattern is what I like to call ""one step above vanilla"" stockinette socks, and the patterning would be perfect for showing off those special skeins of variegated and semi-solid yarns in your stash!

The beauty of this pattern is that it can be used in just about any Cuff-down OR Toe-up sock with great pattern details, simple vanilla socks, and everything in between.  I have always looked for a heel that would be simple to work without having to pick up extra stitches or short rows that left a gap at the corners. This Diamond heel pattern is wonderfully simple and can be adapted for larger/wider feet but will also fit a narrow heel very nicely. You can use this pattern for the self-striping yarn and allow the striping to continue through the pattern without losing your stripes when you insert the heel. This pattern also works well for variegated, tonal, speckled yarns, or any other yarn you fancy.  Welcome to the simplicity of this pattern/recipe and I really hope you enjoy knitting these socks!

> Note: the yardage mentioned on Ravelry is the amount needed for each of 6 colours

This is a double-knit sock using intarsia in the round. I recommend experience with each of double-knitting and intarsia in the round before trying this sock, though the adventurous knitter may choose to skip either of those.

Intarsia in the round is a bit of a misnomer: while it makes a tube, it is worked in rows rather than continuous rounds. Aside from the heel, each of the six yarns will be used in each row of the sock. (The heel uses only 4 colours.) I do not recommend working two-at-a-time unless you really enjoy having 12 yarns hanging off of your needles.

While only one size is charted, there is a page explaining how to modify the pattern for other sizes. The repeat is 6 pairs of stitches wide, so between that and changing the needle sizes, hopefully you can make a sock that fits your foot.

Ross,5.0,38.0,4.0,Stranded Colorwork in the round on larger needles,,"While being out of bed after hours or sneaking around the grounds is forbidden at Hogwarts, this rule does not bother those who are privy to the secrets of the Marauder’s Map. The brainchild of Moody, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, Fred and George Weasley attribute much of their after-hours success in rule breaking to this secret map stolen from Filch’s office. Graphic artist Miraphora Mina, who created the map for the films, said, “It was designed by four cunning kids who were smart and knew what they were doing.” Mina and Eduardo Lima gave the map multiple layers, “Because Hogwarts does feel like it just goes on and on. That was the impression I got from the descriptions of the school, that it was kind of boundless. We felt the map had to have a three-dimensional for to give it the sense that every time you unfolded it, you could be going down to another layer of the school and there could always be another layer that you haven’t discovered yet.”

Manage your mischief in these top-down stranded colorwork socks! After an easy 1 x 1 ribbed cuff, half of the magical spell that opens the map is worked across the front of each leg combined with tiny footprints and magical starbursts. After an Eye of Partridge heel, the mischief managed counterspell is secretly knit into the sole. Kitchener stitch grafts the toe stitches together seamlessly, muffling your footsteps as you solemnly swear to be up to no good.

The result is an elegant “vintage” feel, rather than a “lacy” or “floral” effect. I arranged the narrow openwork motifs in vertical panels separated by purl stitches. In addition to giving vertical definition to the motifs, the purl stitches add a springy ribbed effect that makes the socks hug the foot nicely. To give the illusion of an allover lace pattern, I staggered the lace panels so that the wide parts of one panel nestled into the narrow parts of the adjacent panels. Because this simple pattern is easily memorized, it is an ideal take-along project.""",,846,257,4.6,,Fingering

*Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown
And Jill came tumbling after. * 

*Jack and Jill* is a childhood classic, and these timeless socks are sure to be a sock drawer staple. Playing with simple knits and purls, the left and right feet are worked with mirrored diagonals that change direction when moving from the leg to the foot. When worn together, they can be ‘uphill’ (creating chevrons that radiate upward) or ‘downhill’ (creating chevrons that radiate downward), simply by reversing which foot wears each sock. A contrast cuff, toe, and heel worked in a variegated mini makes these socks both playful and chic.

Summer is almost over!  These are the last of the summer days, these golden days.

Just in time for summers end, a quick knit and these are fast and fun. The lace is simply and flowing. These are ankle socks and they do knit up quite quickly but just in case you would rather have a pair of mid-calf length socks, the pattern can be adapted. Maybe you have the perfect fall color for them in your stash!

The pattern is written for circular needles knitting magic loop style but easy to adapt if you prefer dpns. The socks are knit from the cuff down and the lace is charted only.

It begins with a ribbed cuff, then a section of 1x1 stranded colorwork, then a short row heel using wrap and turn, before finishing with similar colorwork along the foot, and wedge shaping for the toe.

This is an All Together Now series pattern, which means it’s **designed for stash busting all those beautiful leftovers**, scraps, or single skeins. It also works as a beautiful fade for those sock sets looking for a project! Create something in your perfect palette!

Measurements taken after blocking.

Socks are intended to fit with negative ease, however colorwork is also less stretchy than stockinette. Choose a size with a approx. 0.5 in [1.25 cm] negative ease based on actual foot circumference to ensure a snug finished fit.

The length of the cuff, leg, and foot are easily customizable by working more or less of the colorwork chart, until reaching your desired length.

The sample is a size 7, shown on US 8.5 size foot that has 9 in [23 cm] circumference with 1 in [2.5 cm] negative ease. The sample pair is worked with a sock set with one main color and six accent colors as a gradient fade.

Garden Sprinkles is a simple sock pattern that gives you a taste of what it's like to knit with me. The pattern has:

* A little story with the pattern's ""why""
* Clear, line-by-line instructions that have been tech-edited, plus an easy-to-follow chart for more experienced knitters
* Beautiful photographs
* Helpful schematic
* Multiple sizes to fit most feet, from narrow to standard to wide
* Links and hashtags so you an connect with me and my knitting community of quiet progressives

Garden Sprinkles socks are worked top-down and have a heel flap and gusset, which is the style of heel that fits the most number of people (and my favorite, as well). The pattern has alternating columns of double-slipped stitches which create raindrops of color that float along the sock and help break up any potential color patterning.

From the master of mix-and-match design, Wendy Bernard, comes all you need to knit beautiful socks. Consider this the only book of sock patterns you’ll ever need. After making more than 100 pairs, Wendy Bernard knows a ton about the construction of socks—and she knows what we don’t need to know, as we begin our sock-making adventure. In one slim volume, she distills her deep knowledge into everything you need to know, and nothing that you don’t.

These are sock designs that let you begin at the toe or the cuff.

Toe-up socks begin with only a few stitches—a bit of magic that lets you create a toe without have to use Kitchener Stitch. 

Toe-up is the method to use if you're not sure if you have enough yarn.  

You may choose your cuff pattern from any one of the three given on page 21.

You can work a pattern all over the sock, in a panel down the front, or—our favorite when the yarn is wild—a perfectly simple stockinette sock.

Especially if you’re new to sock knitting, we advise you to get the lay of the land in stockinette. Once you’ve done a pair of socks that way, incorporating a stitch pattern from the 13 choices (allover and panel stitch patterns) in this Field Guide will be easy.

The 13 stitch patterns are all modern, clever, and add a little zing to your sock making.

The Comfort & Joy socks are knit cuff down, there is a small section of very simple colorwork, even for a beginner colorwork knitter, the rest of the sock is knit in helical stripes. This pattern is written for magic loop sock knitting and the heel shaping is called a strong heel. This heel fits so well and comfortably, if you have never knit one, I encourage you to give a try and if not you can easily substitute your own favorite heel into the pattern.

**Pattern Description from *Interweave Knits*, Summer 2007:**  
> Master sock knitter Ann Budd uses 2x2 rib for her start-at-the-toe socks. Working from the bottom up, you can knit these socks to stop just short of the ankle or run them all the way up to the knee and even over it. Make these as gifts - the stretchy rib adjusts to fit just about any leg. Ann Budd has never met a handknitted sock she didn't like. She hasn't worn a store-bought sock in years.

**Finished Size:** About 6½ (7½, 8, 9, 9¾)"" foot circumference and 7 (8, 9, 10, 11)"" leg length from top of leg to base of heel for crew socks; 14½ (15¼, 16, 16½, 17¼)"" leg length from top of leg to base of heel for knee socks. Crew socks measure 10"" long; knee socks measure 16½"" long.

**Yarn:** Colinette JitterBug (100% merino; 292 yd [267 m]/100 g): 1 (1, 1, 2, 2) skein(s) for crew socks; 1 (2, 2, 2, 2) skein(s) for knee socks. Socks shown in #85 jay (blue) and #71 fire (red). Yarn distributed by Unique Kolours.

**Yarn Weight:** #1 - Super Fine

**Needles:** Size 1 (2.25 mm): set of 4 double-pointed (dpn). Optional: size 2 (2.5 mm): set of 4 dpn for wider upper leg. Adjust needle size if necessary to obtain the correct gauge.

**Notions:** Markers (m); tapestry needle.

**Originally Published:** Interweave Knits, Summer 2007 

**Notes:**
* These socks are worked from the toe up in a 2x2 rib pattern. Stitches are cast on for the toe in a simple method borrowed from Eastern knitting (where toe-up socks are the norm), the heel is worked in short-rows (a clever method developed by expert knitter Priscilla A. Gibson-Roberts), and the leg is shaped by increasing needle size or increasing stitches.  The rib pattern helps draw in the knitting to make a snug-fitting sock.

* Read more about working toe-up socks in Beyond the Basics on page 24 of *Interweave Knits*, Summer 2007.

I've written it for three colors, but you can easily add a fourth, fifth, and sixth color for the toe, heel, and cuff. If you have many small quantities of yarn then you can start with three colors and bring in additional ones as your initial selections run out. The spiral stripe pattern can easily be adapted for a different number of stripes, too.

I also added some shaping along the back of the leg-the original had no shaping and looked baggy. I was surprised and pleased by the way the leg pattern extends into the heel flap.

Satisfy a princess with princess soles and bling.  Worked cuff down in reverse stockinette, the front of the leg and instep have a twisted stitch cable pattern.  The back of the leg uses pre-strung beads to form a type of cable. 

Due to the beads being pre-strung, the number of repeats worked on the leg needs determined before beginning the sock.  Size 8/0 beads are the recommended size.  

*Bead usage*
Size 8/0 beads are the recommended size and number of leg repeats will determine the total number needed.  
Generous estimate is 300-500 beads (10-20 grams).

Beaded cast on will take 28 (32, 36) beads per sock.
Each repeat of the leg chart uses 26 (30, 32) beads per sock. 

Grey sock shown on pdf is size medium with 5 leg repeats for a total of 182 beads in one sock.

Like broad brushstrokes on a canvas, we can group our stitches together to create larger motifs in our knitting — which is what Jane Cochran did here. The discreet staggering of increases and decreases within a slender purl column creates a gently undulating, barlike ribbing that is both visually appealing and functionally strong and stretchy.

To enhance the sense of depth and movement, the sample was knit in a springy two-ply Sundara Sock Yarn, which gives a hint of shadow to the fabric. The flickering semi solid coloring further enhances the sense of movement. You could also knit these socks out of  a solid color or even a semisolid that incorporates two complementary colors. But be wary of any greater variegation, which could overpower and detract from the subtle beauty of the stitch pattern.

*“And suddenly with the wind came the noises-- the swishing of waves and the slap of water against the ship’s sides and the creaking and the over-all high, steady roar of air and water...”- The Voyage of the Dawn Treader*

The journey to Narnia begins with curling waves and blowing wind as three children are swept away to another world. This sock design will take you on an adventure of your own, mixing colors with a slip-stitch technique to create your own twists and turns. Worked from the top-down with only one color at a time, these socks mimic the appearance of stranded knitting. Using a simple mosaic repeat, you’ll sail along down the leg to a heel flap featuring the slip-stitch pattern. Slipped stitches continue through the foot to provide extra durability for your travels. Navigation is completed as you work a rounded toe, decreasing stitches to your destination… and a new pair of socks.

The Kia Socks are worked from the top down, beginning with the cast on of your choice. A simple texture pattern is worked down the leg to your desired length, and then the heel of your choice is inserted. Pattern includes instructions for a basic heel flap and gusset option. The texture pattern is continued across the top of the foot until desired length is reached. A slightly rounded toe is worked at the end, and the toe is grafted shut with the kitchener technique. 

*This pattern was directly inspired by conversations within the online knitting community involving race, diversity, inclusion, and representation amongst knitters. It serves as a gentle reminder that we all deserve to be heard, to be seen, to feel safe, and to be treated well in this space. Peace, and happy knitting!*",,495,354,4.9,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5",Fingering

This is a Top Down version of the traditional Toe Up sock which has been knit in Turkish families for generations. The sock starts in the round with a 2x2 rib cuff. The leg is then worked to the heel flap, which is worked flat with decreased vertical sides, so it snuggly fits around the wearer’s heel. The foot is then worked again in the round to the flat toe box decreases, and the tip of the toe is grafted together using Kitchener Stitch and working yarn. Note: The leg section is 4 sts larger than the foot. The number sts are easily increased or decreased at the heel flap section for better fit, as desired. The foot and leg lengths below can also be adjusted as desired, based on the total length per size as noted above.

1332165,Grumpy/Sunshine Socks,Lauren Rad,1.75,32.0,4.0,stockinette in the round after blocking,440.0,">This pattern includes a second PDF version that is formatted for knitters with low vision. It has black text, size 22 or larger text in a sans serif font, no italics, no columns, and fully-written directions. Many thanks to Gemma Thompson (gemmabelle here on Rav) for her guidance in formatting patterns in a more accessible way.

I love a good grumpy/sunshine pairing, which is where one half of a couple is an incorrigible curmudgeon, and the other half is overpoweringly cheerful. Many of us carry elements of both personalities within us, and they emerge at different times. It’s extra fun to explore how that dynamic plays out when love and longing get involved.

When I started playing with design ideas for this sock, I knew I wanted to use this skein of beautifully speckled yarn. I also knew, though, that those speckles would make it too strong for a highly textured sock design. In fact, this gorgeous yarn was decidedly grumpy when I started working with it. It needed some sunshine for balance.

So I added a contrast cuff, heel, and toe on the main sample, and then I worked a second sample in the plain yarn. These two pairs of socks together are the perfect grumpy/sunshine partnership, and I plan to keep them together forever. What a splendid happily ever after!

These socks are knit from the cuff down and graded to five sizes. They feature a simple ten-stitch repeat that is very easily memorized. A heel flap and gusset provide an adjustable fit, while the socks are finished with a classic wedge toe.

**Until July 8, buy both Shark Bite Socks pattern and get 20% off!**

Inspired by the cascading rows of teeth in a shark’s mouth, the Shark Bite Socks are a toe up sock with a heel flap and gusset construction that feature a small amount of color play and texture. This pattern is perfect for a high contrast sock set! While this pattern is knit, its companion pattern is entirely crocheted, yet maintains the same look. I wanted to create fraternal twin patterns so that no matter the craft, you can make a sock with this “shark bite” look.

**SIZING**
Sizing is based on the circumference at the ball (the widest part) of your foot. You want your sock to have a snug fit. Choose a size that is approximately 1” smaller than your actual foot. If between sizes, choose the smaller size.

**CONSTRUCTION**
This pattern is designed toe up with a heel flap and gusset construction, featuring a round toe. Colorwork instructions and a visual chart within the pattern dictate the mosaic knitting and striping for the ""shark bite"" motif.

Note: The cuff on this sock has a tendency to flare out a bit. You may want to work it with smaller needles.

**Size adjustments**
If you're working the M (72st) size but want a narrower foot (64st) you can set aside 4 repeats of the diamond pattern instead of the 5 repeats specified in the pattern for the instep. That means the heel flap will have 39 sts instead of 31 and will have fewer rows than the M size. Here are the modifications needed:
*Heel Flap*  -- work over the next 39 sts. Repeat rows 1 & 2 16 times.
*Heel Turn* -- follow the original instructions for the L (72st) size
*Foot*  -- follow the original instructions for the S (64st) size

Laurelhurst Park is a beautiful patch of nature in the center of a busy neighborhood in Southeast Portland. It’s been named “the most beautiful park” on the west coast by the Pacific Coast Parks Association and was the first park to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 

To me, Laurelhurst Park is a fine place to read under the shade of the conifers on a sunny summer day. I designed these socks with conifers in mind for the lace cuff. The detail is inspired by the Douglas Fir, a local tree with a distinctive cone.

Details:
Foot circumference: (2 sizes)
7.5 (8.75) inches (19, 22 cm) unstretched. Will stretch to fit 8.5 (9.75) inches (21.5, 25 cm).

This pattern is worked from the cuff down with two colors. It includes lace, stripes, slipped stitches, a stranded heel flap, and a grafted toe. There are two different striping options: Wide Stripes (Grey and blue sample) and Skinny Stripes (Grey and red sample).

This pattern was tested by Basaltimum and teilzeitheldin. Basaltimum knitted the red pair. Socks were modeled by Star Athena and [Lee Meredith][2]. All photography by [Vivian Aubrey.][2]

**Lumineux**
Top down socks with shapely contrast colour toes and heels. The afterthought heels are innovatively shaped with 4 sets of decreases, to cup the base of the heel like a traditional heel turn. Stitches are increased while placing stitches on hold for the heel, so that there are enough stitches on the sole to wrap around the instep. These are then decreased as for a traditional gusset. Step by step photos are provided for removing the holding yarn and setting up the heel to insure a neat, hole free result. 

Directions are given for the asymmetric toes shown, as well as a traditional symmetrical toe. Lumineux features a simple but impactful textured pattern that’s almost as easy to work as ribbing and which doesn’t fight with speckled yarns. The toes and heel work equally well on a vanilla sock, so directions are included for working the whole sock in stockinette.

**NEW TO TOE UP KNITTING?** 
[Click this link for my tutorial to get you started.][1]

I have included some ""choose your own adventure"" elements in this pattern because those are my favorite types of designs! By changing one or two simple elements, you can knit these socks over and over and make them your own.  Knitting for others? You can alter the stitch count in the center Pathway, or simply adjust your gauge to suit multiple sizes.

My sample sock was knit at a fairly tight gauge (9 sts/inch) because most hand-knit socks will loosen up over time with wear.  The cables and garter stitch balance each other out to create a good fit. My testers found their usually sock sizing and needles fit well. Use a needle size and stitch count that suits you best. There are notes in the pattern to guide you.

The design shows up well in a solid, tonal, stripey or even mildly speckled yarns, but as with all designs, the yarn type and color choice is yours!

CONSTRUCTION

The Super Sprinkle Socks are knit cuff-down, beginning with a German Twisted Cast-On and 2x2 rib. The leg and foot of the sock feature an all-over no-purl texture. A traditional heel flap and gusset make for a great overall fit, and a rounded toe and Kitchener stitch finish off the sock.

7298430,Recreational Tilling Socks,Liz Harris,2.17,34.0,4.0,unblocked stockinette using the larger needles,400.0,"I love knitting textural stitches of all kinds and especially love incorporating them into the socks that I design and knit. I run the full range from very challenging lacy or cable designs to simple knit/purl combinations that are just enough to add some interest while still being easy  and fun to knit. These are some of the latter kind of socks!  

This design grew out of a simple 2/2 ribbing starting point because I didn’t want to clash with the gorgeous long run color gradient of this yarn. As such, the socks retain a lovely stretchiness that is very forgiving when it comes to those of us blessed with thick ankles, high insteps, wide feet and the like. After some test swatching, I came up with this stitch pattern that reminded me strongly of…*something*. Hmmm, I just couldn’t put my finger on it. It made me nuts for a few days and finally it came to me: newly tilled or plowed furrows in a corn field in the spring!

*Anywho*, these socks are worked from the top down with a heel flap, standard gussets and a wide toe. The socks shown are worked in size L and easily fit a women’s US size 11 (European size 41).  This L size would also accommodate the smaller men’s sizes while size XL would be perfect for larger men’s sizes. Sizing is generous for all of the sizes: do not size up. The stitch pattern is given as a simple chart AND as fully written out instructions.

Neville Longbottom is one of the most lovable characters found within J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter Series, in my opinion anyway.  What kind of stitch pattern does one choose when creating a sock for Mr. Longbottom?

940804,Vanilla Socks For Dad,Megan Shufelt,2.67,8.0,1.0,Stockinette stitch in the round,,"My first foray into designing was making some custom fit socks for my dad. I only wrote up the pattern so that I could remember how to knit these socks so I could make many pairs for dear old dad, who has always supported my creative endeavors. 

I unearthed this pattern from the depths of my computer as I was cleaning it out. I wrote this up years ago, before I understood sizing of patterns, so unfortunately there is only one size available. 

This pattern is full of helpful notes that simplify the sock making process. These notes, combined with the basic sock construction, make this a good sock pattern for those new to sock knitting. 

If you happen to be someone, love someone, or know someone with a Men's size 11 foot, this may be a great sock pattern for you!

I used almost all 100 g of my sock yarn for these socks, but I did have enough wiggle room that I did not have to purchase an additional skein. 

Pattern is written with DPNs in mind, as those are my preferred needles, but it should be adaptable to other needle configurations. 

Please enjoy my first ever pattern! Don't hesitate to comment and let me know what you think!

989515,Promises to Keep Socks,KnittyMelissa,4.37,32.0,4.0,stranded stockinette stitch,400.0,"This pattern was designed for the Sock Knitters Anonymous group on Ravelry for the January 2020 Mystery Sock, or MOCK, to fit the stranded colorwork challenge.  Because it is a mystery, no photos are present in any of the clues.  

The clues will be released on January 1, 8, 15 & 22.

The name is inspired by the Robert Frost poem “Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening.”  These socks would be perfect to wear as you take a moment to stop and watch the woods fill up with snow.

**Materials:**
* Fingering weight sock yarn – 48 (52, 56, 60) grams main color (MC) and 38 (40, 42, 44) grams contrast color (CC).  The charts are written for a darker MC.  It is recommended that MC be solid.  The CC can be solid, speckled, tonal, or very lightly variegated.  There should be good contrast between the yarns and no overlapping colors.   *Note that yarn usage is dependent on gauge and foot length.  For tighter gauge or longer-than-average feet, you may need more of each color.*
* One US size 1 (2.25mm) circular needle, 32"" or longer 
* One US size 1.5 (2.5mm) circular needle, 32"" or longer *(optional for colorwork)*
* Locking/removable stitch markers & tapestry needle

This pattern is written for magic loop but can be adapted to your preferred needle type. 

**Four Sizes:**
Small - 60 sts (Medium - 68 sts, Large - 76 sts, XL – 84 sts)

**Gauge:**
8 or 9 spi (stitches per inch) in 2-color stranded colorwork
* At 9 spi, the sock will be 6.7"" (7.5”, 8.4"", 9.3"") in circumference.  
* At 8 spi, the sock will be 7.5” (8.5"", 9.5"", 10.5"") in circumference.  

Remember that stranded colorwork usually has less stretch than stockinette, so plan for little to no negative ease.

In addition, when knitting colorwork socks it's important to leave the floats (the strands of yarn carried behind the work) loose enough so that the socks have some stretch.  It is especially important to do so in the corners where you switch from one needle to the other.  In order to force floats to take the longest path, it can help to knit colorwork socks inside out.  Check out my ""[Colorwork Knitting Inside Out for Socks][1]"" video tutorial.

Please use a spoiler shield as the first photo of your Ravelry project page if knitting this along with the SKA MOCK knit-a-long.

Just a short walk from Notre Dame in Paris is a small royal chapel called Sainte-Chapelle.  This chapel houses 15 stained glass windows, each an incredible 50 feet high.  The patterning in this design is reminiscent of the kaleidoscope feel of the lead-work surrounding the stained glass in these windows.

•	January 1, 8, 15, and 22 (All clues have been released.)

**Three Sizes** 
Small - 64 sts (Medium - 72 sts, Large - 80 sts)

**Materials**
Hazel Knits Artisan Sock or other fingering weight sock yarn  (two solid or semi-solid colors with good contrast recommended)
  •	Color A (CA) - 50-66 grams / 170-220 yards - light solid, tonal, or lightly variegated recommended with strong contrast to CB and no overlapping colors
  •	Color B (CB) - 50-66 grams / 170-220 yards - dark, solid recommended
US size 1 (2.25mm) circular needles, or size for desired gauge.  
  •	Many people go up a needle size for colorwork so if your colorwork knitting is tight, try size 1.5 (2.5mm) needles.
  •	This pattern is written for magic loop but can be adapted to your preferred needle type.  
Locking/removable stitch markers & tapestry needle

**Gauge**
8 or 9 spi (stitches per inch) in 2-color stranded colorwork
•	At 9 spi, the sock will be 7.1"" (8"", 8.9"") in circumference.  
•	At 8 spi, the sock will be 8"" (9"", 10"") in circumference.  

You can adjust gauge for fit by using smaller/larger needles and thinner/thicker fingering weight yarn.  For example, using thinner fingering weight yarn with smaller needles will give a smaller circumference than a heavier fingering with larger needles.  Use the stitch count and your leg/foot measurements to determine what gauge you need for the socks to fit.  Remember that stranded colorwork typically has less stretch than stockinette, so plan for little to no negative ease.

After knitting lots and lots of plain vanilla type socks, I found myself teaching others to make them too.  This pattern was first written for a class to use and has been tested by many students. I included 4 sizes so you can make these for a wide variety of feet.

This easy to follow pattern is written for beginners and beyond in sizes to fit the whole family. It's almost like magic!  Make your socks with a plain stockinette cuff or with ribbing in one of two different options. This is a great pattern even for beginning sock knitters with enough explanation to get you through the rough patches.

Pattern requires fingering weight sock yarn with about 215 - 230 yards per 50 grams.  Extra yarn may be needed for extra-long cuffs or larger men's sizes.

Updated and expanded, this delightful new edition of Silk Road Socks features sixteen intricate patterns inspired by oriental rugs.

All fourteen of the original patterns are here, each revised to fit my current style and with extra sizes added (that includes sizing them all for both fingering weight yarn and dk/sport weight yarn).  There are also two brand new patterns available here for the first time ever.  And of course along the way I’ve upgraded all the fun bits (new photos, new charts, beautiful illustrations…all the things that help make a book lovely)!

Every paper copy of the book includes a unique code (look inside the back cover) that allows you to download a copy of the electronic book.  You'll be able to store the electronic version in your ravelry library if you like (though a ravelry membership isn't required to access the electronic version).

*The Afshari (sometimes Avshar) are a nomadic Turkic tribe originating in Central Asia, now found in parts of Turkey, Syria, and Iran. Most of the rugs woven by the villagers and nomads from this area are called Afshari (even though some are made by people from other groups such as the Buchakchi).*

*Afshari rugs are diverse and use a number of construction methods and feature an array of different designs. Despite this variability, similarities do exist. Most are predominantly red or blue, and many feature repeated horizontal bands of intricate motifs. The cuffs of these socks draw from this tradition and showcase a variety of elaborate textured stitches.*

*“Would I ever leave this company? Look, I’m all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I’m being paid for here is my loyalty. But if there were somewhere else that valued loyalty more highly… I’m going wherever they value loyalty the most.”
– Dwight Schrute, The Office*

Dwight Schrute is an iconic character, known for his die-hard loyalty to Dunder Mifflin who dreams of one day being a manager. Like Dwight, these socks are trusty and reliable. Worked from the top-down, knits and purls create textured triangles along the leg and instep. A contrast cuff, heel, and toe highlights the simplicity of the design, which makes for a sock that is both interesting and predictable to knit. So, whether your interests include bears, beets, or Battlestar Galactica, this footwear is perfect for anyone aspiring to be Assistant to the Regional Manager.

The ripples remind me of rolling hills or mountains in the distance, so as I was driving through the Berkshire Mountains in western Massachusetts, that seemed a perfect name.  

There are two sizes available - Medium (66 sts) and Large (78 sts).  The pattern is a great introduction to relatively simple chart knitting, and it uses only knits, purls, increases and decreases to create the patterning.

**YARN RECOMMENDATIONS**
 
Sample knit with Dyed in the Wool Co.
Yakity Yak 100g in “Nobel”
This pattern looks great in a tonal, solid, speckle or tweed.  Lighter colors show off the textures best, but it also looks very rich in a deep jewel tone.  It can hold up in a more dramatic speckle, but highly varigated yarns might lose the texture.

*Your lens on life and mine are not the same.  We may be living the same circumstances but experience them very differently.  Things can also look quite different during a period of challenge.  What was once smooth and predictable can become rough, disorganized. These two states of being, even and uneven, often occur right alongside each other, touching different parts of us at any given time.  A smooth path for some can create a rough road for others.  Repetitive knit patterns on a textured sock help me bring reflections like this into view. In stockinette, the colors in a yarn behave one way; add a few purl stitches and those same colors look completely different! Tame and textured; now and next.  Both are valuable and worthy of our energy and attention.*

**Needles & Notions**:  32 in (80 cm) circular needles in US 1/2.25mm (for sock cuff) and US 1.5/2.5mm (for sock body) for Magic Loop, or needles for preferred method, tapestry needle, scissors, removable stitch markers (optional) 

This pattern gives instruction for the Magic Loop method, knitting cuff down, one sock at a time on a single circular needle.  The Needle ends are referred to as N1 and N2. Adjust the instructions to your preferred knitting method (DPNs, 2 circulars, two at a time, etc.).

Looking for a good beginner sock knitting pattern?
You’ve just found it!
 
The Basic Toe-Up Socks patterns are simple vanilla sock patterns that fit 12 sizes from Babies – Adult XXL. They features a simple 1x1 ribbed cuff, stockinette body, short row heel, and wedge toe. Each section of the pattern also includes links to online tutorials that walk you through the how’s and why’s of creating the socks.
 
These tutorials (and this pattern) make up the free Beginner Toe-Up Sock Knitting Class that was offered on YumiYarns.com in January 2021. With everything covered in the approximately 2 hours of free video lessons, even experienced sock knitters might find a new trick to add to their repertoire.

*Pattern includes 2 files. One for the Kids sizes and one for the Adult sizes.*

**Notes**
Pattern includes links to relevant tutorials. Tutorials are also posted to the the [YumiYarns Tutorials][10] page.

The needle size listed is the needle size I regularly use, but I am a very loose knitter so you may need to go up 1-2 needle sizes to get a fabric that you like. Most knitters do well with US size 2 (2.75 mm) & if you are a tight or newer knitter you may want to try a US size 3 (3.25 mm). If you know your standard needle size for sock knitting, use that instead of what I have listed (the size that gives you gauge).

Make sure that your beginning of round marker is different from your other markers so you can tell the difference. Locking markers are recommended .

This pattern has been test knit and Tech edited.
(Thanks, [Kathie][11] & test knitters!)

It's officially spring! The seedlings are popping up everywhere, from overwintered seeds that self sowed the autumn before. Everything in the garden is waking up and something new pops up everyday throughout spring. 

These socks were inspired by all the little seedlings that sprout. The sock is textured with 3 stitch cables that are off set. Creating a lovely seedling look when knit from the toe up. The pattern uses a chart and written instructions and is written using the magic loop method for socks. You will need to be familiar with the Turkish Cast on and the sewn bind off. A cable needle helps with the cables but the cables can be done without one as well. I used all of the 50 gram skein of yarn for a pair of socks. You may need more or less depending on your own feet.

Pattern is available in 17 size/yarn weight combinations and is suitable for top-down or toe-up... and it will look great either direction!

This is a real scrap-buster too!  Arrange your scraps into lights and darks or just use the grab bag method.  Have fun with it!

Materials:

- sport weight yarn (same total weight) - OR -
- DK yarn or 2 strands of fingering held together, same total weight

You can use the toe, heel, and cast-on or bind-off that you like best, or try the Elegant Toe or the Welsh Heel that are included in the pattern.  Pattern also contains helpful links to different cast ons, bind offs, Kitchener stitch, and foot lengths for children through adults.

Many toe-up socks that I’ve knit have come close to the fit of the heel flap and gusset technique, but they’re always missing something.  I figured out what it was and reverse-engineered my favorite fit! 

Are you wondering, “But why are we fading into Neverland?”  These socks are perfect for those two lonely— maybe One of a Kind—skeins (aka Lost Boys) you have loitering in your stash, or that just went up for sale on your favorite shop.  You know they’ll look fantastic together, you just aren’t sure how to get them to play nicely.  This is their chance to shine!

(I’m not a crazy person, I don’t normally dream about socks.) Named after my friend Eunice, these socks are sunny, fun, and a little bit odd.

While I could have charted this pattern or written it out row by row, it’s much easier to knit this sock if you “read” your knitting rather than follow a chart. Directions are provided with pictures, but I promise you it’s easier than it looks. By providing instructions for reading your knitting, it’s much easier to customize your sock to your liking and to adjust sizes.

**These socks are NOT mirror images of each other.** I *hate* working left twist stitches :)

222896,Java Socks,Cailyn Meyer,3.57,36.0,4.0,stockininette stitch,400.0,"From [Knitty, Winter 2011][1]

*These socks are slightly caffeinated. Enough to keep you awake, but not enough to make you jittery, just like good java should. The tiny wiggles are fun to knit and the perfect opportunity to practice cabling without a cable needle- only two stitches in each cable and there are tons of them!”*

*My favorite part about these socks is the patterned gusset. After the stitches are picked up from the heel flap, the gusset stitches are worked in the rib pattern and the decreases consume the instep stitches instead of the gusset stitches. The ribs eventually merge and continue down the foot to the patterned toe. The toe is also different than normal; most of the decreases are made closer to the middle of the toe to allow the pattern on the side of the foot to continue to the last possible moment. Then the last stitches are decreased rapidly for a flat, graft-less toe.  The pattern is extremely stretchy with a wide, round heel turn that is comfortable for a range of sizes. Lucky for these socks, the ribbing period coincided with a desire to design men’s socks. I thought to myself, “What’s more classic than a ribbed dress sock? The larger size fits me, a women’s size 8, and my husband, a men’s size 11!*

Men’s Toe: There should be “work even” rounds on Rounds 22 and 24 of the toe, which aren’t shown on the men’s charts but are in the written instructions.

*“Edward in the sunlight was shocking... His skin... literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface.. ” 
– Twilight, by Stephenie Meyer*

Edward Cullen is an iconic vampire, immortalized by Stephenie Meyer in the Twilight series. Though 90+ years old, he still appears to be seventeen. Most shockingly of all, though, is that his pale skin sparkles like diamonds in the sunlight. These socks embody his fiercely protective spirit. Art deco diamonds reminiscent of an earlier era work their way from the toe up and around the leg of this sock. The cables are created with simple left and right twists, with no need for a cable needle (and a video tutorial to guide you through the steps). Knit in Lolodidit’s Sparkle Sock, this striking footwear will make the diamonds sparkle in the sunlight, creating stand-out footwear that is a classic in any age.

*“And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles.”
- The Secret Garden, by Frances Hodgson Burnett*

The wonder of watching flowers bud and blossom every spring is a miracle that transforms the dark, cold days of winter into a bright and beautiful new season. These toe-up socks create tiny blossoms out of sock yarn, using increases and decreases to form a charmingly patterned pair. Surrounded by lace latticework, the stitches are intutitive, easier than they look, and create a gentle rhythm while knitting. Just as the gardens outside begin to come alive after a long winter, your yarn will be transformed into something truly magnificent.

Enjoy an automatic 20% discount on this pattern bundle through the end of August to help me celebrate its release :) thank you so much for your support, I hope you love your socks!**

***

This bundle includes three different versions of the pattern: a heel flap version, a Fleegle heel version, and a shortie sock version! Each is worked cuff down, and has the same texture around the sock, the only differences are the length of the sock and the heel construction :)

This sock series was inspired by a quarterly yarn club themed around the Legend of Zelda video games – one of the challenges in many genres of video games is the completion of quests: there’s usually a main quest driving the storyline, with several side quests to keep you busy and build your character’s skills. Some are quick and mindless, while others can be intense and difficult, and with this sock series I aimed to capture this range of challenges so that you can customize your ideal “Quest” yourself!

The heel flap and Fleegle heel versions of these socks can be worked in a single color, OR you can add in a second color to make a contrast toe and corrugated ribbing cuff! The corrugated ribbing is a very easy-to-learn colorwork technique :) Additionally, the only chart in these patterns is in the Fleegle heel version, to work increases at the heel in the round. All other instructions (including those for the corrugated ribbing) are entirely written out.

I've made SEVEN samples of these socks, [here is a link to their project pages][1] with the yarns, yardages, sizes, and needle sizes I used!

Entire Series is out and published! 

Looking for a little more than a vanilla sock for your striping sock yarn? Summer Stripes Sock Series patterns are perfect for you!

Calle Cables is third in a four part sock series that works perfectly with self-striping sock yarn. This design is a simple four row repeat using knits and purls as well as a simple cable that is excellent for the first time sock knitter or the knitter looking for a pattern that looks great with stripes.

I have included where to insert a contrast heel flap if it is desired but it’s not necessary. Linked in the pattern are two different tutorials for kitchener stitch (these are outside sources and not my own).

I used two skeins of Felici, about 66 grams of yarn for a women’s size 8.5 US foot.

The promise of spring is such a wonderful time of the year. There is a magic in growing things. Daffodils and tulips poking through, buds and blossoms, and the bees buzzing around. Everything just bursting to life. Walking along garden paths is one of my favorite things to do!

The wavy cable and garter provide an interesting yet simple enough design that can be memorized after a few repeats. The design is charted and written chart instructions.

**Supplies List**

 **Yarn**: 100 grams/ 400 yards of fingering weight yarn. Sample knit in: Oh! Loops Yarn Co. in the Christmas in the               Burrow colorway on the Ascot fingering base (80% Superwash Merino/20% Nylon) 100 grams/400             yards

 **Needles**: US 1/2.25mm – Your choice: DPN’S, Magic Loop using a 32” cable, 9” Circular. Pattern is not written                   for a specific way of working in the round.     
**Note about DPN’S: If you choose to use DPN’S for this pattern I would recommend keeping the                  patterned section on 1 needle. The pattern is only worked across the front half of the sock so you                   would have 28(32,36) stitches on 1 needle and then the back of the sock split between 2 needles. 

**Notions**: Stitch marker                   
                    Tapestry needle for weaving in end

**LYKKE ~** The Danish word for happiness

And almost nothing makes me happier than a pair of colorful, hand-knit socks! In deep winter, when the world outside is looking rather gray, and light is scarce and fleeting, a pair of warm, wool socks bursting with colors and patterns is pure medicine - a prescription for Lykke!

These socks are deceptively simple. You never knit with more than two colors at once, and the simple 2, 4, or 8-stitch repeating charts are easy to follow. I’ve included instructions to knit the original multi-color socks using all fourteen charts, as well as recipe cards to knit a few more variations. It’s quite easy to take the original sock pattern and create your own magic by combining the charts in whichever ways you please! Use two colors or twenty - it’s entirely up to you.

I’ve included a handy reference sheet for you to write out the yarns and colors you are using, along with the order of the charts you prefer. I’ve also included a picture tutorial for working an Afterthought Heel.

Glad Strikning!

**Pattern Notes**
These cabled socks are worked in DK weight for a fast weekend project! Worked in the round with cables that slowly taper outwards and inwards, creating fern-like shapes on the front of the foot. The sole of the sock is knit in stockinette and the heel features shadow wrap short rows. Read full tutorial on pages 8-13 before starting your socks. A videotutorial is also linked on page 3. Toe is worked in a smaller needle for a tighter gauge that creates a reinforced toe. Sock pattern includes two foot circumferences, Medium (7”/18 cm) and Large (8”/20 cm). Sock has 1”/.25 cm of negative ease. Size down when choosing your sock circumference. The footbed length is adjustable. Pattern is written in Magic Loop but Dpn’s can be used instead. Use Dpn 1 & 2 for FN and 3 & 4 for BN.

Many thanks to Gemma Thompson (gemmabelle here on Rav) for her guidance in formatting patterns in a more accessible way.

The 2024 Golden Honey Sock Club is devoted to historical romance archetypes. I’m a sucker for a good ballroom drama, a society scandal, or a duel at dawn. There are certain characters you encounter again and again in these environments, and seeing them show up always makes me happy.

The first archetype in this year’s club is the Willful Wallflower. A wallflower is someone who is rarely asked to dance at a ball and usually spends the evening tucked among the potted ferns. A person can become a wallflower for many reasons. They might be shy, lacking connections, or socially inept. My favorite wallflowers, though, are those who rarely get asked to dance because they’re just too darn opinionated and outspoken. 

These socks are knit from the cuff down and graded to five sizes. They feature a richly textured leg and a simple stockinette foot. A heel flap and gusset provide an adjustable fit, while the socks are finished with a whimsical star toe.

Knit cuff down with heel flap/gusset construction, ending with wedge toe.  The sock starts with a garter stitch accented ribbed cuff.  A fun ripple lace (which works well with stripey yarns but would also look very elegant in a solid or semi-solid yarn) flows down the leg and continues onto the instep.  The heel features an Eye of Partridge with garter stitch border heel flap.

We spent 5 days at the coast in a sleepy town taking in ocean views and taking full advantage of the lazy pace.  I had picked up a sock set as a souvenir that reminded me of the wild ocean and foggy marine layer that hovered over the bay for the extent of our stay.  I wanted a simple, rhythmic knit that I could work on while the boys played in the sand and I was soaking in little pockets of sunshine.

I heard the term slack tide used in reference to crabbing.  When I researched it, I found that it is the brief period of time where the tidal water is completely unstressed.  It happens before the tidal stream reverses.  This pattern is a perfectly relaxing knit that is meditative, uncomplicated and unstressed. 

This sock has been described as potato chip knitting by testers that have raved about how quickly it knits up.  The purl channels create small goals and make each section fly by.  Its a great sock for gift knitting and is easy for beginners, but interesting enough for skilled knitters and would be a perfect addition to your arsenal if you are looking for a new non-vanilla/but vanilla-ish pattern.

This pattern is intended to be a great basic in your pattern library.  It wooks great for just abotut any sock yarn.  A semi sold, solid or self stipiing will highlight the subtle purl channels best.  You can also knit this with a contrast for the heels, toes and cuffs, or in a single yarn.

For years, I have been a knitter.  Throughout that time, I have knit my mom many, many items.  However, socks are the one item she has never wanted me to knit for her…until now.  This year, for Christmas, my mama said she “wished for a pair of socks of her own.”  This simple sock pattern was written as something special for my mother.  

This pattern features a simple mock cable pattern going down the front edges of the sock from the cuff down to the toe. The back of the sock is knit in stockinette.   It is constructed with a heel flap, gusset, and a modified wedge toe.  This sock is knit from the top down but could be easily adapted to a toe-up version if you prefer.

Sized to fit women's U.S. shoe size 6-8.

From the pattern notes: *I'm not much of a lingerie type of gal. Most days I can&rsquo;t even be bothered to hang earrings in the holes in my earlobes. So I had a little trouble getting my head around the lingerie theme for this staff project...until I realized that I do like to lounge on the couch while I knit or read. And I do love socks. So I decided to make a pair of special lounging socks. The yarn, conveniently named Seduction, is a mixture of merino and tencel that's warm, comfortable, silky soft, and strong.""

This project is shown on pages 50-51 of *Interweave Knits*, Spring 2007. The pattern is NOT in the magazine, however. Readers are instructed to find instructions on the website.

While there are many neat Police Box sock type patterns out there, I found that I was forever needing to do some serious modifications to help them fit my feet. Either the colorwork was much too tight, the rest of the sock was much too loose, or I needed to have another sock pattern to use alongside the pattern. No more! This pattern is a complete sock pattern that is knit top-down with a heel flap. Other heel styles can easily be used in place of the heel flap.
        
The idea behind the shaping of this sock is that there are more stitches for the colorwork, which allows the sock to fit  the calf, and fewer stitches for the rest of the sock so that it doesn't fall down the leg.

The baluster on a staircase is the vertical post linking the handrail to the stairs themselves. Many balusters together help support the railing. While the spiral of the design on these socks reminds me of a spiral staircase, each individual column also reminds me of a decorative baluster. They work together to support the sock and keep our feet cozy.

These socks are knit from the top down with a ribbed cuff, heel flap and gusset, and wedge toe. They are graded to three sizes for a wider range of fit. The ribbing that runs the length of the sock helps keep them snug and supportive.

The original Dawn Socks were a gift I made for a dear friend's birthday. She has this creative soul and such a love for being with people who bring her joy. I wanted to combine some of our favorite colors, have the socks actually fit her, and to be able to knit them up with ease. And thus, the broken rib, multicolored, garter stitch heel socks were born. 

As soon as I realized how much I loved these socks - I knew I wanted to write the pattern up. I have gotten so many questions about a go-to or beginner sock pattern. Part of what I love about knitting is COLOR! and these socks give you permission to go wild with color choices. Choose the colors that bring you joy. 

Yarn support and general encouragement came from the lovely Colleen, of [Little Lionhead Knits.][1] Her bouncy sock yarn and vintage eye for bright color combos made her perfect for this collaboration. I also love that she stocks single mini skeins - so you are easily able to create your very own custom sock set. 

I am so delighted to share these socks with you! I can't wait to see your versions.  Please share your WIPs, HOs, and FOs with the hashtag #DawnSocks.

When they accidentally chipped old paint off the doorframe on moving day she wondered how it would feel to live somewhere new. The first holidays came and went, quickly turning their hands with a detached unfamiliarity. The heaters didn’t make the right noise on Christmas and the sound of Thanksgiving dishes didn’t clank up the stairs. Even so, it was  an amiable old building with uneven horsehair plaster walls that she trailed her fingers across every night as she went to bed.  Cracks in the horsehair. Scuffed pine plank floors. Imperfections.  Late at night, alone in the dark, she danced. She danced sockfooted with those scruffed floorboards, unraveling their every move & sound, and as she danced, she learned.  In that season she learned that home was not in the house but within her own body. Love was the act of growth and change as much as calm and peace. In those moments, she learned that to accept a home there had to be as many good days as bad, a full spectrum of life. The floors, more beautiful for their wear because of the ones who had worn them, waited for her sock feet once more.*

Since March of 2020, I’ve read nothing but romance novels. I found that, in the midst of all the chaos and sadness of the pandemic, I needed a guarantee that things would work out for the good characters I loved, that the bad guys would get their just deserts, and that the author wouldn’t kill off one of the main characters.

So, I decided to honor the genre that helped me survive the last three years. This is the first pattern in a quarterly sock club where each design will be named for some of my favorite romance novel tropes. The Duke Who Gives It All Up is named for one of my very favorites—the person who walks away from power, fame, or gobs and scads of money because they realize those things aren’t what truly make them happy. If you want book recommendations, I’ve got a few for this one!

These socks are knit from the cuff down and graded to five sizes. Between the four panels of lace, stockinette columns expand the circumference in the larger sizes. A heel flap and gusset provide an adjustable fit, while the socks are finished with a classic wedge toe.

**Yarn**
1 Lattes & Llamas [Untitled Goose Socks Kit][1] or a comparable sock weight yarn in three colorways. 

Sample Size 2 used “Moiraine” as Color A, “Baskerville” as Color B,  and “Plastic Pumpkins” as Color C on Lattes & Llamas [Vacation Yarn][2] (75% Superwash Merino, 25% Nylon; 463yds / 423m – 100g) featured in the Untitled Goose Socks Kit.

Color A: 208(232, 255, 283) yds / 190(207, 245, 262)m - 45(50, 55, 61) g
Color B: 60(70, 79, 88) yds / 55(64, 72, 80)m - 13(15, 17, 19) g
Color C: 83(93, 102, 116) yds / 76(85, 93, 106)m - 18(20, 22, 25) g

Note that yardage is estimated, includes the yardage required for knitting the swatch, and may vary depending on yarn used, gauge variations, or modifications. 

When choosing your yarn, make sure Color A contrasts strongly with Color B. We recommend taking a photograph of the yarns together and then change it to black and white to see if they contrast strongly enough.

**Needles**
US 1.5 / 2.5 mm and US 2.5 / 3.0 mm 40” circular needles to work in Magic Loop or size needed to obtain gauge.

40” circular needles are used to work in magic loop, which is my preferred method of knitting socks. However, they can be worked on DPNs or 2 circular needles if preferred.

**Gauge**
32 sts and 40 rows = 4” / 10 cm in stranded colorwork, knit in the round with larger sized needles and blocked. 

Instructions for a functional gauge swatch in the form of a coffee cozy are included in the pattern.

**Sizing**
Size 1 (2, 3, 4) has a 7 (8, 9, 10)” / 17.75 (20.25, 22.75, 25.5) cm foot circumference, unstretched.

With yarn colors evoking a sense of ocean waves lapping at sandy beaches, and beautiful flowers and foliage, this easy eyelet pattern flows in a wave formation between the garter stitch sandbars.

While knitting the standard sized sock with double wave panels, I decided I needed to see how a shortie sock with single wave panels would look.  Both versions are included in this pattern!

**Leg and foot circumferences** (length adjustable) 
Small: 7 and 6.5 inches / 18 and 16.5 cm 
Medium: 8 and 7.5 inches / 20.5 and 19 cm 
Large: 9 and 8.5 inches / 23 and 21.5 cm
*Adjustments can be made to width of foot and leg at side rib panels. Stitch totals will be affected but pattern is written to work with adjustments; no need to rewrite or recalculate.*

**Yarn requirements and notions**
Yarn: 270(320,420) yards or 225(290,385) meters. Best in space-dyed, painted or variegated yarns with contrast. Not recommended in solid or tonal colors. 

Notions: circular stitch markers to place on needle (4) and removable markers to hang on stitches (8-10); yarn needle for weaving in ends.

**Construction Notes**
Two identical socks are worked cuff down in a diamond pattern using shadow-wrap short rows. The gussets are worked at the ankle followed by a Strong (or inverted Fleegle) heel. The wedge toe is grafted with Kitchener stitch.

All instructions are written, with charts accompanying the instructions for the diamond stitch pattern. Construction diagram included.

Photos of shadow-wrap stitches and lifted increases included, as well as links to photo and video tutorials for any stitches that may be unfamiliar (see same links below).

**What to know before you begin**
Basic sock construction, working in the round on double-point or circular needles, increasing and decreasing. Experience with short rows is recommended. 

Backward knitting makes the short rows go faster by eliminating turning (see tutorial link below) but is not necessary; pattern assumes normal turning for short rows.

There are four sizes available for this sock: 56, 64, 72, and 80 stitch counts. The pattern is of average stretchiness, so whichever of those sizes usually works for you is what you’ll want to knit. One skein of yarn should be enough for most sizes, unless possibly you’re knitting for very large feet.

**Notes**
Be sure to choose yarns with high contrast and no similar colors between the two yarns. If there is any overlap in colors, the design will become muddled.
When working stranded colorwork, one color will be dominant, meaning that the stitches are slightly larger and this color will be more prominent. In this design, you can choose either color to be dominant, but the important thing is to be consistent. To do this, make a note of how each color is held and be sure that the position of the yarns remains the same throughout the socks. ",,73,101,5.0,"S (M, L)",Light Fingering

*“Anne’s beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily in. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child; but this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.” 
– Anne of Green Gables*

The imagery created by L. M. Montgomery allows readers to step into the verdant beauty of Green Gables. These top-down socks allow you to dip your foot into the fantasy, with lace leaves growing around the leg and down the toe. Twisted ribbing creates striking lines along the length of the sock, while being both rhythmic and relaxing to knit. While we may not be able to walk the roads of Avonlea, nobody can stop us from dreaming!

-------

Wraptor is the love child of two other knitty sock patterns, Skew and Longitudinal. It's what happens when you take classic sideways sock construction and work it on the bias.

This pattern does not require expert knitting skills, but it does require strong spatial skills and/or a willingness to trust the pattern's instructions even if they seem wrong to you.  It might be hard to believe that it will turn into a sock, but trust me, it will.  I've done the math.

I can't emphasize enough the importance of doing all of the following before you cast on:

1. Knit a swatch.
2. Match stitch gauge.
3. Don't just measure row gauge when relaxed and call it done.  Stretch your swatch as diagrammed in the pattern to make sure it reaches at least 6 1/4"".  (If it doesn't, there are course corrections available -- but my recommendation is to try to match stretched row gauge.)

---------

**Errata in the pattern PDF**
Page 6, there are a few places where I say ""turn to WS"" on a WS row.  Hopefully it's evident that these are typos and it's supposed to say ""turn to RS,"" sorry about that!

In the section *Knitting the Mate:*

1. Page 13, the cast on diagram was
   accidentally moved up a few lines; it
   belongs right below *""Flip your
   cast-on over so the purl side is
   facing you.  It should look something
   like this:""*  Note that the diagram
   reflects what the cast on looks like
   after all stitches are cast on and
   the needles are flipped over so that
   you are looking at the purl side.
2. Page 14, in section Stage 3, just
   under ""Setup 1: Adjust Stitches""
   there is a reference to *""This should
   be your total stitch count""* but no
   corresponding image.  This line of
   text doesn't actually belong here. 
   As you work the mate, refer to the

   view from the purl side.

I can guarantee you that 99.9999999% of the time, I have a vanilla sock on the needles. I've knit so many pairs that I could probably knit one in my sleep. But let's not test that. Holding knitting needles while asleep probably isn't a great idea. ;-)

A vanilla sock pattern is the perfect place for a beginner sock knitter to start. But it's also a great solution for advanced sock knitters who want to add in a cable or lace that you've found in another pattern.

I prefer to knit my socks on what I've affectionately named Zoom Zoom Needles [9” (23cm) circular]. I renamed them because you can just zoom zoom round in circles. I knit the toe using magic loop and the zoom zoom needles for the rest of the sock.

In this pattern, you'll find both toe-up and cuff-down instructions for knitting a basic vanilla sock. So grab your french vanilla cappuccino, your needles, and your yarn so we can cast on! Happy Knitting!

~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲~✲

These socks are knit using the magic loop method (although the purchaser could easily adapt it for two circulars or double points).

This pattern includes both toe-up and cuff down instructions.

Judy’s Magic Cast On and Jeny’s Surprisingly Stretchy Bind Off are used in this pattern for the toe-up sock. German Twisted Cast-On and Kitchener stitch is used in this pattern for the cuff down sock.

The knitter needs to be comfortable with the following techniques: knit, purl, ktbl, k2tog, ssk, M1R, M1L, & W\+T. Instructions for all these techniques are included in the pattern. In addition, [a video tutorial for the shadow wrap technique of W\+T for short rows][4] has been recorded by the designer.

This pattern includes instructions in written form for 56 stitch, 64 stitch, and 72 stitch socks.

― Edith Sitwell

I can't think of anything more well said about winter. A winter where most of us will be spending it at home. What makes winter time even more comforting and warm, is a pair of socks so cozy and comfy they feel like slippers. For this pair of socks, I used worsted yarn by itself and then knit a pair held double with suri lace. Its great having options. The socks are loose fitting but snuggly. There are instructions for toe up and cuff down. The pattern uses magic loop construction and the texture for the socks is so simple, it can be easily memorized. You can change the size by changing your needle size.

> Sassy Socks are the ultimate in instant gratification knitting! Turn a machine knit tube into a pair of beautiful hand-dyed socks in no time at all - just add the ribbing, heel, & toe and you are ready to go. These Sassy Sock Tubes tubes are hand dyed after they are knit, so the finished socks retain the painterly beauty of the hand dyeing process.

> The pattern now contains bonus instructions to make fingerless Sassy Mitts with your leftover sock tube! Each mitt uses about 4.25"" of the sock tube and 7 grams of contrast yarn.


These socks are made from a hand dyed sock tube. This is a tube of stockinette stitch machine knit at a circumference that can be used for making socks. These tubes are hand dyed after they are knit, so the finished socks retain the painterly beauty of the hand dyeing process.

You can purchase the [Sassy Sock Tube Set from Marianated Yarns here.][1]

The tubes are about 50” long- if you want to make 2 pairs of socks, that gives you almost 12½” of sock tube per sock between the toe and ribbing. I used 9¾” of the tube for each of my socks.

For picking up stitches, I like to go down to a size 0 US/2.0 mm needle.

**Measurements:** 
Sock tube circumference of 64 (72) sts. 

These are machine knit tubes, and the fabric is fairly stretchy. Even though the tube may be narrower than your typical hand knit sock, the extra stretch allows the socks to fit comfortably.

**Sock tube and yarn:** 
Marianated Yarns Sassy Sock Tube Set; approx. 50 inch length sock tube with coordinating 50g skein of yarn; 75% superwash merino/25% nylon, shown in Cassis Drift.

**Needles:** 
Size 1.5 US/2.5 mm circular needle, 32”/80cm long, or preferred needles for small circumference knitting in the round, plus extra needles for picking up and holding stitches. Adjust needle size if necessary to obtain the correct gauge.

**Gauge:**
About 9 sts and 11 rows = 1”/2.5 cm in Stockinette stitch knit in the round, or stitch gauge needed to approximate the gauge of your sock tube. The gauge of your tube may vary, try to get as close as possible, but it doesn’t have to be exact.

**Notions:** 
Removable stitch markers, tapestry needle.

The smooth knit side of the stockinette faces inside against the sole of the foot for a more comfortable sock. The trick is that the foot is knit inside out. No additional purling is needed. The leg and instep are ribbed for a stretchy, comfy fit.

There are two versions, one for cuff-down socks with a heel flap and gusset and another for toe-up socks with a boomerang short-row heel. The simplicity of the pattern makes this an easy knit and allows these instructions to be used to reverse the foot of almost any sock pattern. Use Daylong Socks as a blueprint to improve the comfort of your next socks. 

As a bonus, there is a supplemental pdf containing instructions for continuing the toe-up socks to knee-high length. (Added on March 23, 2014)

As of March 21, 2014, the pattern has been revised by the designer and technically edited by Amy Jones.  Formatting was changed to follow the standard and typos were corrected.  Prior to that date, this pattern was published as three separate patterns, including one longer version that provided instructions for both toe-up and cuff-down.

I know that seems odd given that winter is the time for knitters to shine. Maybe it’s the lack of natural insulation I have on top of my head, or perhaps the aches, which get more pronounced every year, I feel in my joints. In fact I dislike the cold so much that I moved to a subtropical climate.

Because of this dislike of cold, I always feel like celebrating once Spring arrives. The air is warm, the sun is shining, and flowers are blooming. It’s enough to make one want to sing a song of triumph.

Ancient Greeks liked to sing songs of triumph too. They would sing a thriambus, which honored the god Dionysus. I celebrate sunshine. Ancient Greeks celebrated alcohol. To each his own.

Some of my testers used more solid colors and others more variegated and it worked well for all of them. Obviously, a more solid yarn will always show a pattern more clearly, but the pattern does hold up to some variegation.

In Minnesota, it is not uncommon to hear the term Up North, which generally means anything north of the Twin cities metropolitan area.  Minnesotans go “up north” in the summer as well as winter. The Boundary Waters canoe area is so popular that children and families return year after year to portage, canoe, hike and camp.  The Land of 10,000 lakes is obviously know for spending time on, in or near the water. Boot socks are necessary in many seasons as they are ideal for hiking as well as snow skiing. These cabin socks can be worn inside a hearty winter skier’s boots for Nordic or downhill skiing as well as in summer while hiking on the Gunflint Trail. My husband and I stayed at the Bearskin Lodge for several summer and winter vacations when we were first married. This summer we went back after 30 years away and although we portaged, husband carried the canoe and I carried the poles and gear; we were a bit out of our element (forgot the bug spray.) However, our worsted weight cabin socks served us well. I highly recommend them for any woodsy time at the cabin you have planned.

YARN: 250(300, 350) yds worsted in main color with contrast colors for, trim toe and tiny pompom or tassel. 
 
SAMPLE is knit in Kelbourne Woolens Lucky Tweed (100% merino wool; 210 yds/190 m/100 g per skein) colorway 058 Light Gray and contrast colors 615 Tomato, 412 Navy, 305 Pine and 734 Golden.

SIZES: (Adult S, M, L) 

MEASUREMENTS: Cuff/Leg/Foot 8(9, 10)“ circumference (adjustable by adding or decreasing 5 stitches to cast on number)
This stitch pattern has a bit of give to it and is written for negative ease. I recommend measuring your foot and going down in size if in doubt. Alternately, it would be workable to knit the sock at a slightly tighter or looser gauge to allow for better fit.	

NEEDLES: US #4/3.50 mm dpns 

GAUGE: 20 sts and 30 rounds /4” in Andalusian stitch.

This pattern includes instructions for both a toe-up (pg. 3-4) and top-down (pg. 4-5) DK weight sock with a Shadow Wrap Heel. This sock is sized for the whole family, child through large adult. It is worked using magic loop; needle 1 will be front of foot/instep/leg, and needle 2 will be back of foot/leg and heel. *(If you have larger calves and are knitting tall socks [crew, not shorties], go up a needle size for the cuff, noted below on both versions.)

This pattern is meant to be a starting point for your sock knitting, just a st st/vanilla sock. You can knit this pattern all in one color (no CC), but you will need to adjust the yardage requirements. Feel free to make a shortie pair or taller socks, whatever you want. You can also add in a stitch pattern or ribbing; the possibilities are endless. I added a chart for simple colorwork at the cuff if you would like to try it. Colorwork charts for both versions found on page 7. *(It is a good idea to weigh your starting yarn before your first sock, only use half per sock. Then, weigh as you go to make sure you will have enough for your chosen size/length.)

This pattern flips the original design upside down. Increases on the bottom of the foot create room in the gusset area. The heel turn then cups the back of the heel, and the remaining decreases create a faux heel flap. As in the original pattern, there are no stitches to pick up!

To knit this pattern, you need to know how to:

* do a cast on for a toe-up sock (Judy's Magic Cast On, figure-8 cast on, etc.),
* do lifted increases,
* do basic decreases (ssk, p2tog),
* knit and purl in the round, and
* do a stretchy bind off.

The pattern includes notes on how to adjust the placement of the heel if your round gauge differs from the gauge given in the pattern. Also, as with the original, this heel can be placed into any other pattern with the same stitch counts.

Most people will need roughly 100 g of fingering weight yarn to knit a pair of these socks; actual yarn usage will depend upon the size made and the length of the foot. If you are knitting the largest size and/or have very long feet, you may require more than 100g. Please make sure you have enough yarn to complete your project with the leg length you desire.

The simple rounds will result in a visually appealing and comfortable sock; a classic style perfect for both men and women. The simplicity of the ribbing also lends itself to a wide variety of dyed sock yarn: everything from solids and tonals, to speckles and variegated, to self striping.

I designed this sock to be an easy-to-knit variation on a basic ribbed sock.  The ribbing in this pattern is symmetrical, so both the left and right sock will match perfectly. Depending on the size of the sock, the pattern is slightly different in order to accommodate the number of stitches cast on.

1325378,Solution Socks,Amanda Stephens,4.33,36.0,4.0,Stockinette Stitch,460.0,"DESIGN INSPIRATION

The Solution Socks are a “solution” for how to mix speckles and cables. This braided cable and faux rib texture pattern highlights the lovely yarn that you’ve been saving for a special project and is cozy and squishy while still providing a wonderful in-shoe fit.

CONSTRUCTION

The Solution Socks are knit cuff-down, beginning with a German-Twisted Cast-On and 1x1 rib. The legs of the socks are knit identically, but a bit of magic when setting up for the heel flap results in a beautiful pair of mirrored socks. A traditional heel flap and gusset are used to allow the pattern to shine, and the foot of the sock is finished off with a rounded toe and Kitchener stitch. Carefully placed increases and decreases prevent puckering at the start and end of the braided cable.

</em>
<p class=""bodytext""><em>I designed and knit these                              socks while manning our booth and interacting                              with folks at the Broad Ripple Art Fair in Indianapolis.</em></p>
<p class=""bodytext""><em>The pattern is a deceptively                              simple ripple stitch, comprised of only two                              rounds, one of which is a work even round. Using                              just a few well-spaced increases and decreases,                              you create a wonderful ripple fabric that looks                              more intricate that it really is. </em></p>
<p class=""bodytext""><em>The yarn also adds to the                              fun of the sock. Equally beautiful in a solid                              or variegated, the combination of cotton and                              elastic means that the knitted fabric can stretch                              for a larger leg or snug up to a smaller one.                              Just alter the length of the foot to fit you                              [or your intended giftee].</em></p>
<p class=""bodytext""><em>A side note: on the first                              day of the fair, some very rough weather passed                              through, including a tornado warning and heavy                              rains. An hour later, the sun was out and the                              crowds returned, along with television crews.

The Aine sock (pronounced awn-yah) is inspired by my oldest daughter.  She is an amazing person; part goof-ball, part old-soul and always creative, colorful, and fun.  This sock invokes her spirit, with layers of texture that keep it interesting, and a whimsical style. They work with anything from the subtlest of colors, to the brightest speckled and variegated yarn around.  I hope these socks bring to your needles even just a fraction of the joy that Aine brings to my life.

Classic striped socks worked from the toe up with contrast toes and heels. The stripes are worked using the helix method. It’s a surprisingly easy to work technique that takes advantage of the fact that knitting in the round is really a spiral to avoid any visible jog when changing colours. The heels are worked using my favourite method afterthought heels with gusset shaping that seems to fit all foot shapes well. Ten sizes are included from toddler to large men’s so you can make them for everyone on your list.

Sturdy sport weight yarn with good memory, wool or wool nylon blends are ideal.

*“Another legend claims that we descended from wolves– and that wolves are our brothers still.”
– Jacob Black, Twilight*

Jacob Black is a Quileute who grows up surrounded by legends that are destined to become his reality. Seeing Bella Swan sets events in motion that will change both of their lives forever. These top down socks use a predictable cable motif that twists and turns, entangling itself throughout the leg of this sock. The traveling cables give way to thick cords of ribbing along the heel and instep, creating a comfortable fit when worn inside shoes. Life is full of twists and turns, and these socks can take you every step of the way.

Two different sized socks are possible by changing yarn weight and needle size. The pattern instructions proceed from the cuff down with double pointed needles. The ribbing on these socks is quite stretchy so it’ll fit a range of sizes and won’t kick off easily.

Updated and expanded, this delightful new edition of Silk Road Socks features sixteen intricate patterns inspired by oriental rugs.

All fourteen of the original patterns are here, each revised to fit my current style and with extra sizes added (that includes sizing them all for both fingering weight yarn and dk/sport weight yarn).  There are also two brand new patterns available here for the first time ever.  And of course along the way I’ve upgraded all the fun bits (new photos, new charts, beautiful illustrations…all the things that help make a book lovely)!

Every paper copy of the book includes a unique code (look inside the back cover) that allows you to download a copy of the electronic book.  You'll be able to store the electronic version in your ravelry library if you like (though a ravelry membership isn't required to access the electronic version).

*Kazak is one of the trickier names to explain. There is a town called Kazak (or Gazakh) in the northwestern corner of Azerbaijan. But, other than in old books about rugs, that’s not the name of a group of people in the area. Some have suggested that the term is a corruption of Cossack, while others think it comes from the name of the town. In any case, Kazak rugs are made by Armenians, Azeri Turks, Georgians, and Kurds living in the area between Tbilisi and Erivan. The city of Kazak is more or less is in the middle of this region, so it is a convenient marker on the map for these rugs.*

*Kazak rugs are usually made with wool dyed in bright colors with red and blue being most common. They use large-scale, geometric motifs with strong, angular lines. This sock uses the deep blue common to the region and strips the characteristic angular lines to their most basic form.*

*“Bubbles, bubbles everywhere, but not a drop to drink… Fizzy Lifting Drinks.  They fill you with gas, and the gas is so terrifically lifting that it lifts you right off the ground like a balloon.” – Willy Wonka; Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory*

Light and airy, Effervescent will have you bubbling over with knitting enjoyment. These socks are worked from the top down, with a predictable lace pattern that gives the appearance of bubbles floating up the leg of the sock. A traditional heel flap gives way to a non-traditional gusset along the bottom heel, while ribbing along the back of the leg makes for a perfect fit. Suburban Stitcher’s hand-dyed yarn creates a perfectly playful pairing without overwhelming the design. Does life have you grounded? It’s time to Effervesce.

*Lace pattern is both written and charted.*

Clearly confused. Alone together. Weirdly normal. Bittersweet. 2020 has been full of oxymorons and contradictions, so it seems only natural that I should be designing for Christmas in July! These socks play with contradictions, mixing up colors to create something truly unique. While most knitting lace charts have an even number of rows, this one has an odd number. It might seem crazy, but it all works together to create a perfect pair. Choose your favorite sock yarn in six colors like the sample, in a single color, or in a different color for every stripe. Sometimes it’s the contradictions in life that create the happiest surprises!

Last night I was a queen. It’s really splendid to imagine you are a queen. You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to, which you couldn’t in real life.”* - Anne of Avonlea

Inspired by the auburn, or red (depending on who you ask) hair that is Anne’s most distinctive physical feature, and the red clay soil of Prince Edward Island, this simple sock is something I imagine Anne would have knitted and worn many times throughout her life. This pattern has just enough detail to keep one interested while knitting and the lace patterning brings a little beauty to her everyday knits. 

*“I finished my sixth pair of socks today. With the first three I got Susan to set the heel for me. Then I thought that was a bit of shirking, so I learned to do it myself.”* - Rilla of Ingleside

Anne’s daughter Rilla absolutely loathed turning a traditional heel flap sock, but that would’ve been the predominant sock heel type in World War I. How Rilla would enjoy trying out the Fleegle Heel, an alternative heel turn that starts bottom up! This one’s for her.

I wanted a pattern that was simple enough to show off the yarn, yet would have enough pattern to draw interest (namely MY interest!)  I searched for a lace panel that would do well even in dark or colorful yarns, and designed these socks around it.

The lace is a simple 4-pattern- row repeat that is easily memorized and constructed. It lines up perfectly with the gusset decreases to form an elegant curve down the outside of your leg. The panel is placed on the outside front edge of each sock so that it is easily visible from either the front or the side of your foot. 

Much to my joy, I had about 1/3 of my yarn left, so I also threw together some matching wrist warmers.  If you're looking for a quick gift with 50 grams of yarn or less, these warmers might just be the ticket!  They are constructed as a simple tube with a small gusset for a well fitting thumb, and can be completed in just a few hours. If you've got small feet you may have enough leftovers from your socks to make both. 

If you're not a spinner, these socks will do well in most yarns suited to the gauge (thick fingering to very light sport).  I particularly recommend darker shades of hand-painted yarns.  ",,1548,2438,4.35,"S, M, L, XL",Fingering

The method I describe in the instructions does not use waste yarn and includes cutting into your knitting after the rest of the sock is complete.

Récamier is the first in a series of lounge sock patterns.  As a child I loved visiting my Grandparents in California.  My Grandmother is a huge influence on me as an artist. She always had a sculpture in progress in her studio space; I loved the smell of damp clay and all the intricate tools on her worktable.  In the evenings she would sit and work on a needlework project in her favorite chair.  My Father's family immigrated to the US from China when he was in grade school, and their house was filled with family treasures, sculptures, art, and formal furniture that were off limits for children to play with or jump on.  However, there was a cozy, soft chaise lounge that my Grandmother called Madame Récamier (named for the style of lounge chair made famous by the painting Portrait of Madame Récamier by Jacques-Louis David) that my cousins and I would always hang out on.  It was the perfect napping spot when I was young, and as I grew older it was where I would sit and knit and read.  When I decided to create a series of lounge sock patterns, I knew I had to pay tribute to my favorite childhood lounge spot.

Récamier is a top-down sock with a unique high-low shaped ribbed ""lounge"" cuff.  It has a short row heel and a simple stockinette foot, perfect for showing off self-striping or gradient yarns.  The toe is asymmetrical for a comfortable fit.  The instructions are written to be accessible for all sock knitting methods.

*Socks are a great comfort. Grab a cozy pair of socks, your favorite hot beverage, and cuddle in bed with a movie or book of your choice and it is like the best instant comfort.  This new decade came with renewed hope and promises but started on a gloomy note. During trying times like these, seeking comfort is one of our best options to help process the stress and find the motivation to move forward...one day...or mile at a time.  Here’s to the rest of your year being unexpectedly awesome and better than you hoped!*

*Mile Forward socks are knit in the round from the toe to the cuff. They feature wedge toe shaping, the Fleegle heel method, and a central lace motif that travels gracefully up the leg. Because the lace motif is not mirrored, you will simply need to repeat the instructions to make two the same. This is a one-circumference-fits-many pattern but you can adjust the foot length and leg as you desire. The Fleegle heel method is a genius technique created by Susan Glinert Stevens A.K.A. [fleegle](/people/fleegle) on Ravelry. Thanks, Susan! While I knit my samples as cropped versions, you can make your leg longer if you'd like*

It should read (changes in bold): Setup rnd: (MC) Sl 1 wyb, k15 (17, 17, 19, 19), pick up and knit 15 (16, 17, 18, 19) sts along first edge of heel flap, **pick up and knit 1 st into the corner between the heel flap and instep**, k27 (29, 31, 33, 35) sts across instep – this corresponds to rnd 12 of the st pattern – pick up and knit 1 st into the corner between the heel flap and instep, pick up and knit 15 (16, 17, 18, 19) sts along second edge of the heel flap, k8 (9, 9, 10, 10). This is the new EOR; place marker or rearrange sts as you prefer. **75 (81, 85, 91, 95)** sts.

What sock knitter doesn’t have a stash of leftover bits of sock yarn? The Meta Socks take advantage of those, with extra scraps taking on a whole new life and serving as reminders of past projects. The yarns shown here include indie talent and commercial favorites—yarn from a trip to South Africa, swag from a knitting retreat, and yarn from the first dyer to provide yarn support to Mary when she was a new designer. This pattern can serve as a tactile holder for beloved memories. What story will your socks tell?

Each band of color requires about 4 yards (3.6 m). Play with color and dye jobs; this sock can handle about any dye technique as long as the main color retreats into the background. Don’t be terrified at the thought of all those ends! The pattern calls for minimal finishing at the end. Or take another approach altogether and let the yarn work for you by pairing a solid main color with a slow gradient or self-striping yarn.

The design features stitch patterns that mimic the architectural elements on the palace's facade, especially the twisted stitches at the cuff that are inspired by the interlocking columns in the palace's top-most floor. The sock design includes a seed stitch heel flap and pinstripe ribbing.

The Doro Socks are knit cuff-down in the round with a heel flap and gusset. The pattern includes charted and written instructions. *D'oro* means ""golden"" or ""of gold"" in Italian, which is a perfect adjective to describe the Sunflower colorway from Stress Knits Yarn who generously provided yarn support for this design.

The fact that in the past we have mostly only seen tweeds in darker or more neutral colors makes the new brights seem all the more robust. 
 
I love bright colors and the new tweed sock yarns available in non-traditional colorways are just stunning.

SAMPLE
Adult medium sample socks were knit in Little Bean Loves Yarn Confetti Sock (85% SW Merino, 15% Nylon/Neps; 438 yds/400 m/100g) in a robust bright orange; weighing 76 grams using 332 yds /303 m. 

PATTERN NOTES
Written for both DK and Fingering weight yarns, this collection includes ‘top-down’ socks, cast on at the cuff, then worked in the round on double pointed or circular needles to the heel. 
The Dutch heel flap is worked back and forth in rows, and then the heel is turned. Stitches are picked up along the heel flap, and the work is joined in the round and the gusset stitches decreased. 
Each sock in this collection is embellished with an optional pear-shaped button, bead, or charm. 

ERRATA: There is a mistake in stitch count after the heel turn, on page 4, Next Row. It has been corrected. (This should not have affected your ability to knit the sock.) Pattern was updated 12/28/21

The magic of The Secret Garden encapsulates the growing and changing of both children and plants throughout the book. These top-down socks use cables and lace to create tangles of tulips down the foot of the socks that Grow Together as you knit them.

The main pattern is a 6x2 rib and there are 8 repreats of this 8 stitch pattern which makes them 64 stitches. By using slightly thicker or thinner sock yarn and different size needles you can vary the size. I've made these for many different sizes of feet. They are stretchy and fit very well.

If desired, you can carry the ribbing down the heel flap for a very nice fitting heel.

*“‘There’s no use trying,’ [Alice] said: ‘one can’t believe impossible things.’

‘I daresay you haven’t had much practice,’ said the Queen... Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.’” - Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*

Playing with colors while knitting can be a challenge and many knitters shy away from it. Mosaic knitting is a chance to make the impossible possible... a way to give the illusion of stranded colorwork while only working one color at a time. Worked from the toe-up, these socks pair stunning gradient mini-skeins with a semi-solid neutral to create a graphic and eye-catching design. Give them a go and redefine your idea of what is possible!

The whole cafe always emanated a glow of golden warmth- the dim lighting revealing ribbons of dimension in the old building’s polished woodwork. It always smelled like hot pastries, freshly ground beans and other people’s perfume. Despite this, It wasn’t about the drinks- even though the coffee was perpetually hot and the scratched white mugs were always full. No, this place held more than just that. As she shrugged out of her old cold-weather jacket, she noted that the stained couch by the bay window had been replaced. She carefully set some notebooks and her favorite good-handwriting pen on the little table before it.  It sat slightly turned out, facing upper Front street. This spot felt like the hollow beneath a hemlock- cozy, and hidden yet visible. Perfect for observing as she wrote.

Two older men, one an author of tweed and tortoiseshell, the other a fisherman with rainwater and salt still dripping off his boots, were having an animated conversation about zoning ordinances by the back corner. In the alcove by the local art, an earthy mother broke apart a danish much to the glee of her messy haired toddler. Two women, sleek and professional with id cards clipped to their blazers offered crisp smiles as they filled up travel mugs. A young, hip couple sat in the center of the room, (obviously on a romantic getaway), dreaming over stuffed croissants and planning a future.

They all seemed so interesting. Each generation, each path so different from one to the next. She stole a glance back over towards the author. ‘I wish I had written something by now. Why would my work matter, though?’ As she gazed around the room, she realized she wanted to sit down and know every single person’s story.

Leannán means sweetheart or darling in Scottish/Irish Gaelic, which I found to be the perfect description for these socks. The slipped and cabled stitches look like hearts. I love how the variation in the yarn really shows with the slipped stitches. 

Makes these for your friends, your family, your lover, your Leannán. Pick a yarn you love for the person you love and create the simple socks yet beautiful socks. Leannán is a six row repeat that is very easy to memorize and can be done without the cable needle if you are comfortable. I hope your sweetheart loves them!

Heartsplosion is a stranded colorwork sock pattern that is written in three sizes. Each size has been individually charted so that they all have the full Heartsplosion effect.  While the three sizes have slight differences in the charts to make this happen, they are all similar and will be recognizable as the same pattern.

While this pattern is perfect for using scraps or miniskeins, it can also be made using just one contrast color throughout. 

Great for Valentine's Day!

Links to two video tutorials are also included.

There is an extensive notes section that gives many tips on knitting stranded colorwork socks, and making sure they fit.

There are two files that come with this pattern: the main file that includes the pattern and all the charts, and a second file that consists only of larger sized versions of the charts, in case the charts in the main file are too small to work from comfortably.

After he was diagnosed with cancer, he tries to secure his family’s financial future by making and selling meth, but just how far was he willing to go before he breaks bad?

The socks are designed to mimic the double helix – a nod to Walt’s chemistry background. They are knit cuff down, with a large cable down the middle of the socks, a slip stitch heel flap, and a rounded toe.  

There are four (4) sizes available with this pattern – Extra Small (60 Stitches), Small (64 Stitches), Medium (68 Stitches), and Large (76 Stitches). If you need a different size, just make sure you have at least 28 stitches for the design on the leg and foot. I added four stitches to each size to account for the cable pulling a bit in the middle.

*The mosaic colorwork in these socks is a perfect candidate for mini skeins or those smaller remnants of yarn that many of us have lying around in our stash. Work one colorwork motif or two to customize the length to your liking!*


**NOTES**
**Design & Construction:** The Taos socks are knit from the top down in sections that alternate between stockinette and mosaic colorwork. The heel is constructed with a traditional heel flap, turn, and gusset.

**Fit:** These socks are designed to be worn with approximately 0.25 to 1 in. (1 to 2.5 cm) of negative ease. To pick the best size for you, measure the circumference of your foot at the fullest point (this is usually right where your foot and your ankle meet) and subtract 0.25 to 1 in. (1 to 2.5 cm). Make the size with a finished circumference closest to that number.

**Length:** This pattern includes instructions for two lengths: half-calf and quarter-calf. Knit these socks with either one or two bands of mosaic colorwork to create your desired length!

**Stitch Patterns:** The mosaic colorwork stitch patterns in this pattern are only charted, so you should be confident in your chart reading skills—or be open to learning!

Smocked stitches are just so fun.  They give a wonderful three dimensional texture that shows up well on a variety of yarns.  While smocked stitches are quite easy, I did decide to space these out so that making them doesn’t interrupt the knitting flow very often.

The smocked stitches lie on a textured background, which is flanked on both sides by columns of twisted stitches.  The pattern is on the front half of the sock, while the back is all knit.

*“Who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew, cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two? The **Candyman** can ‘cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good.” – Bill of the candy shop; Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory*

Brightly colored yarns are a sure way to satiate any knitter’s sweet tooth, though it can be a challenge to properly show them off. This design highlights the incredible hues of Spun Right Round ‘Blender’ by creating sprinkles of color across a dark background. The colors create tiny diamonds across the leg of the sock and are highlighted in the cuff, toe, and heel. Color, texture, and playfulness are at the heart of this design, perfect for the original Candyman himself… or his sweet-loving customers.

The needle size listed is the needle size I regularly use, but I am a very loose knitter so you may need to go up 1-2 needle sizes to get a fabric that you like. Most knitters do well with US size 2 (2.75 mm) & if you are a tight or newer knitter you may want to try a US size 3 (3.25 mm). If you know your standard needle size for sock knitting, use that instead of what I have listed (the size that gives you gauge).

Make sure that your begining of round marker is different from your other markers so you can tell the difference. Locking markers are recommended .

When I saw the intense, bright colors of this jungle themed sock set, I knew I wanted to make some bold, graphic flowers in the contrast colors, but I wanted it to be a quicker knit, so I chose mosaic knitting to create the flowers.  I added some detail down the sides of the sock in the main color that represents vines.

Feel free to play with the amount of contrast colors used; as shown, they are great for scraps or small miniskeins, but would also look good using a single contrast, or alternating two or three contrast colors.

These lacy socks offer a bit of ribbing for stay-up stretch while an easy four-row repeat pattern makes for an interesting knitting experience.

GAUGE: 15 sts = 2 inches **in pattern st.** (lace-rib stitch is stretchy, so this is approximate);  35 sts to 4 inches **in stockinette.**

NOTE:  Often on the same sock you will find there are different gauges, especially when there are lace pattern stitches.   So the tighter gauge was measured on the plain stockinette sole portion of the foot, and the looser gauge on the lace part.  The lace-rib pattern is stretchy and forgiving.

That’s where the inspiration for Cozy Hiker socks was born! I wanted a thick and warm sock in a pattern that was not only easy and quick to knit up, but had a lot of bounce back and hugged you snuggly — helping to reduce any slippage and frustration while keeping you focused on the path ahead of you. Paired with a contrasting color for your cuff, heel, and toe, these are just the CUTEST high calf socks to show off over your favorite jeans or leggings. I hope you enjoy making and wearing them as much as I have had designing this pattern for you!

Musings:  I like to give a few actual yarn usage stats on my pattern page, as an indication of real-life yarn usage, especially for socks that can use multiple CCs.  In my above examples, I am Tester #1 for this particular pattern.  While yarn type has something to do with this, even with subtracting 5g from my total CC usage for the extra CC section, I used more CC than what my testers used, even after accounting for one sock vs two.  I knit my socks both inside-out and using Ladderback Jacquard (LBJ), and I have very stretchy colorwork socks.  Perhaps I add more ladders in my LBJ than my testers do - I do not know.  But it follows that the more yarn you end up using, the more stretch your socks will have.",7.0,33,125,5.0,"S, M, L",Fingering
1338647,Autumn Seedling Socks,Amanda Stephens,0.0,36.0,4.0,Stockinette Stitch,420.0,"DESIGN INSPIRATION

The Autumn Seedling Socks are inspired by morning walks in early fall. Imagine a two-year-old child moving at their own pace and stopping to lock eyes with the squirrels that are foraging acorns from the base of a large oak tree. Together you count the squirrels and any unclaimed acorns. You can feel the cool breeze as the weather shifts from the squelching summer heat to a delightfully crisp autumn. You inhale deeply before taking a sip of your warm coffee and continuing along the path.

The acorn-style faux cables and seedling no-purl texture in the Autumn Seedling Socks gently highlight that gorgeous skein of yarn that you’ve been stashing for the perfect project, and the easy-to-memorize pattern results in a relatively quick knit.

CONSTRUCTION

The Autumn Seedling Socks are knit cuff-down, beginning with a German Twisted Cast-On and 2x2 rib. The leg and foot of the sock feature columns of acorn faux cables and an all-over no-purl seedling texture. A traditional heel flap and gusset make for a great overall fit, and a rounded toe and Kitchener stitch finish off the sock.

15-20g of contrasting sock yarn for heels and toes (more if you'd like to do a contrasting ribbing as seen in sample)

Is there anything better than a stretchy sock that knits up incredibly quickly? We don't think so! Introducing the Brioche for Brunch Socks by the talented Saysha Greene @insayshable.knits, featuring a Waffle Stitch created with half-brioche rib that is shockingly straightforward. (Really! One of our testers who had never knit a sock or done brioche before said **""This feels too easy!!! Am I doing it right?""** ). Featuring vivid colors from Less Traveled Yarn in  Melon Mimosa and No Big Teal, you’ll want to knit these socks again and again.

If you’re new to sock knitting, we have you covered. Like every Knitrino project, we provide videos for every technique. You can also earn your Brioche for Brunch Badge, and join our **Intro to Brioche Workshop on Zoom on Sunday, October 23 at 1pm EDT (GMT -4)**. Our kits are sold out, but you can pre-order your kit from our friends at Traveling Yarn. 

**Size and Fit**: These socks are incredibly stretchy with just the right amount of slouchy, and most knitters won't require modifications.  For many people, more than 1 size may fit their foot. First time sock knitters should follow the pattern as written without modification. 

**Construction**: These toe-up socks begin with a modified version of the Magic Cast On that prevents twisted stitches on the sole stitches. The socks are worked in the round one at a time using Magic Loop, though you can easily substitute your favorite sock method. The heel turn is worked back and forth on the base heel stitches in short rows. After this, the wrapped stitches are resolved, and the gusset stitches are decreased as a part of the heel flap.

**What’s Knitrino**
Knitrino offers curated projects featuring new patterns in Knitrino’s friendly format and all the supplies you’ll need to go from cast on to bind off effortlessly, plus badges for each new skill.

1352346,A Good Grovel Socks,Lauren Rad,0.0,32.0,4.0,stockinette in the round after blocking,440.0,">This pattern includes a second PDF version that is formatted for knitters with low vision. It has black text, size 22 or larger text in a sans serif font, no italics, no columns, and fully-written directions. Many thanks to Gemma Thompson (gemmabelle here on Rav) for her guidance in formatting patterns in a more accessible way.

One challenge when you fall in love with someone is the question of what happens when one of the partners screws up in a spectacular fashion. Romance writers love to play with the most disastrous incarnations of those relationship screw-ups, to see how far they can push partners before their reconciliation makes no sense anymore.

And a key factor in that? A good grovel. The more somebody screws up, the better their apology needs to be, at least as far as I’m concerned. The road to a really good grovel will involve layers, some thorny twists and turns, sparklingly wonderful moments that make the partners want to stick it out and find a way forward, and most importantly, a satisfying resolution.

In fact, it’s not unlike the front panel on these socks, which I designed with some particularly good grovels in mind. These socks are knit from the cuff down and graded to five sizes. They feature a richly cabled front panel and a simple stockinette back. A heel flap and gusset provide an adjustable fit, while the socks are finished with a classic wedge toe.

Minerva McGonagall is one tough lady and one of my favorite characters from J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter Series.  Crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, I always wondered what type of socks she would wear while teaching her students Transfiguration.  I ended up going with this stitch pattern because of the simple elegance and because I thought it might speak to her normally hidden girly-side. 

Consisting of a knit and purl pattern, the sock is knit from the cuff down and features an eye of partridge heel flanked on either side by garter stitches.

Sample socks were test knit and photographed by the lovely [Absinthia][1] - a big Thank you to her :)

Four classic cables in a progression of 1/1,  2/1,  and two variations of 2/2 cable cross, as well as four plain ribbed variations, making eight ways to knit a sock!

Step-by-step instructions are provided for each section of the sock. Video tutorial links are provided for the cast-on, bind-off, and brioche decreases. The pattern notes include tips on fit, tensioning in-the-round, and brioche in-the-round. 

The socks are knit from the toe-up and in-the-round. The pattern uses a reverse Strong heel variation. The Strong heel is an attractive heel that gives plenty of room over the instep and is also really fun to work. There is no need to pick up stitches for this heel. The appendix includes additional heel decrease variations. I just couldn’t resist playing with possibilities for this heel!

**Construction**
These toe-up socks begin with a modified version of the Magic Cast On that prevents twisted stitches, and like every stitch in our Knitrino workshop-style projects, if you don’t know how to do it just click the Magic stitch to see how  The socks are worked in the round one at a time using Magic Loop, though you can easily substitute  your favorite sock method. One of our favorite parts of these socks is the fun and easy “afterthought” heel, where stitches are placed on waste yarn for an easy way to complete the heel later. 


***What Knitrino Is***
Knitrino is a community builder, a place to craft with intention. We offer curated workshop-style projects crafted for small screens. Our goal is to not only make patterns easier to use, but to also support & uplift our awesome community.

Knitrino is an innovator. We believe that knitting can unlock magic within every person, and we want to make it as easy as possible for people to create. That's why Knitrino gives you so much more than just a pattern - every project comes with mini-workshops to help you create effortlessly. Click a stitch to see how to do it, highlight your current place, get step by step pattern tracking, see charts in your yarn colors. 

 

***What Knitrino Isn't***
We're not in the PDF business because Knitrino isn't just a pattern. Our interactive tools make knitting a project more like a workshop and there's no way to turn one of our patterns into a PDF. 

Knitrino isn't a massive database with millions of projects. Knitrino works a lot like a magazine, offering curated projects from designers we love. The patterns are also only available for sale for a limited time, but once you purchase a pattern, it's yours for keeps. 

*A note from us*
We're a self-funded 2-woman sisterly startup, who left our careers to invest in the crafting community we love. This is just the first version of Knitrino–we know there's a lot more you'd like to see, but since we are small we started with the features knitters told us were the most important to them.

7338050,The Reformed Rake,Lauren Rad,0.0,32.0,4.0,stockinette in the round after blocking,440.0,">This pattern includes a second PDF version that is formatted for knitters with low vision. It has black text, size 22 or larger text in a sans serif font, no italics, no columns, and fully-written directions. Many thanks to Gemma Thompson (gemmabelle here on Rav) for her guidance in formatting patterns in a more accessible way.

The second archetype in this year’s Golden Honey Sock Club is the Reformed Rake. “Rake” is short for “rakehell,” an old-fashioned slang term for someone (usually a man) who leads a scandalous, dissolute, aimless life. In historical romances, you’ll usually find a rake spending his evenings in gaming hells and his mornings sleeping off a hangover. He may have fought a duel or two, and he’s definitely overspent his allowance. He’s full of subtle quips and is probably a lot of fun to hang out with for a while, but don’t expect him to show any discipline or commitment to anything—or anyone.

My favorite rakes, though, are the ones who end up discovering that there’s more to life and more to themselves. Whether they find joy in work that has been thrust upon them, steadiness in caring for younger siblings who end up needing them, or love with the last person they ever expected to settle down with, the reformed rakes always make my heart thaw just a bit.

These socks are knit from the cuff down and graded to five sizes. They feature braided cables that symbolize the rake’s journey toward finding himself and some eyelets that help let the light in. A heel flap and gusset provide an adjustable fit, while the socks are finished with a classic wedge toe.

This sock pattern is written for two circular needles.  It can easily be adapted for double points or magic loop.  The pattern is for a plain vanilla sock.  You can add any design to it you want.  I've included a chart at the end for different weights of yarn and different sizes of sock.  The pattern is written for a 64 stitch sock.

Because I have big feet, I always found myself either running short of yarn on a cuff down sock, or wasting a lot of yarn and making the cuff not as long as I wanted.  I wanted to make toe up socks for this reason but didn't like the short row heels I always found in the patterns.  Therefore, on a long drive to North Carolina from my home in Western Pennsylvania, I decided to 'reverse engineer' a traditional gusset heel, toe up sock so I could make the foot as big as it needed to be and the cuff as long as the yarn yardage permitted.

In my mind at least, they slightly mimic the most fun detail on a western-style boot — that little seam running down the outside of the leg. The sock ends with a wide toe that can be made short, medium or long.

Besides just looking cool, that little line of garter stitch seems to make the knitting go faster than plain stockinette. As a bonus, it makes counting rounds absurdly easy, so you don’t have to worry about losing your place when you make the second sock (or the heel flap).

It uses a Balbriggan heel, which takes just a small amount of grafting to finish. It's well worth it, I promise. It looks and wears like a dream.",,318,101,4.6,"Women’s XS (Women’s S, Women’s M/Men’s S, Women’s L/Men’s M, Men’s L, Adjustable Size)",Fingering

1096874,Coffee Time Socks,Knits By Chaerry,2.47,36.0,4.0,Stockinette,437.0,"This pattern was inspired by the conversation that I had with my brother on coffee. We realized that coffee can be a morning ritual to someone, and it can be a special treat to others. I thought sock patterns are quite similar in some way — some are simple and easy, while others are advanced with colorwork, lace, or cables. I thought I could make a pair of socks that can be enjoyable for many knitters. I wanted to make a pair of socks that is classy but with a twist so that it can be a wardrobe staple or a statement item to finish your outfit.

This pattern was designed with beginner sock knitters in mind, so it makes a cable pattern without using a cable needle. 

If you want the texture and stitch definition of the faux-cable to stand out, I recommend using solid color yarns.

The pattern calls for a 2.25mm needle, but you may use a 2.5mm needle if you like a more relaxed fit.

The finished Shop Window Socks are mid-ankle height, comfortable to wear year-round. They are worked from the top down, starting with twisted ribbing, and feature a window-inspired geometric colorwork design on the leg. They have a flap and gusset heel with a subtle diamond texture on the heel flap. Ribbing on the top of the foot continues the vertical lines of the colorwork design and gives a snug fit, and a small band of diamond colorwork is added just before the toe. A perfect relaxing and portable summer knit!

I’m on a mission to fill every sock drawer in the world with beautiful, hand-knit socks!! I felt the only way to achieve this mission was to design socks that EVERYONE could feel successful at knitting. 

I do realize that turning a heel and knitting a gusset aren’t the worst things in the world, (in fact, some knitters really enjoy that step,) but I’ve always dreaded it and it was the one thing that prevented me from knitting all the socks.

The sock itself is basic flap and heel construction, but I’ve used a variation I learned at Sock Summit 2011 from Clara Parkes to add stretch to the flap and make the heel last longer.  I really like how it looks too.  

I absolutely love these socks, the bow ties are so fun to knit.  I dare you not to think “Cool!” when you knit one.

I cried to these songs, and laughed, and sang my heart out in quarantine. And a year after its release, my favorite song from the album, “Invisible String”,  inspired this simple, elegant shortie sock pattern. As knitters, we hopefully will always have “wool to brave the seasons.”

Designed in collaboration with Rachel of [Six and Seven Fiber][1] and Emma of [Bloom & Create][2]. Updated in November 2021 to include a mid-calf version of the pattern. Full instructions are available for both the shortie (original) and the full version.

This pattern is written top-down for a Magic Loop needle setup.

>I am a fan of bright socks. They’re bold. ~ Matt Smith, English Actor

Several years ago, I saw more tweed yarn available from Indie Dyers at shows around the US, but it wasn’t as common to find bright colored tweed. Until I saw some at Rhinebeck and bought several bright colors. 

Now years later, I have fallen down the DK Tweed rabbit hole and designed these socks as a collaboration with Dianne of Suburban Stitcher yarns and thought I should also include fingering weight socks as well. 

Named for Pears as this collection resembles the lovely colors of a variety of pears but also because everyone loves a little play on words, especially a former English teacher. Thus, the Pears of Socks Collection. But please, choose some bright colored tweed yarn and cast on!

Adult small sample socks were knit in Mt. Rusten Studio Little Abbey Fingering Tweed (85% Bluefaced Leicester, 15% Nylon; 438 yds/400m/100g per skein) in colorway Jamacia; weighing 76 g and used 333 yds/304m. You can purchase here: [Etsy][1]

Written for both DK and Fingering weight yarns, this collection includes ‘top-down’ socks, cast on at the cuff, then worked in the round on double pointed or circular needles to the heel. 
The Dutch heel flap is worked back and forth in rows, and then the heel is turned, stitches are picked up along the heel flap, and the work is joined in the round and decreased through a gusset. 
Each sock in this collection is embellished with an optional pear-shaped button, bead, or charm. 

ERRATA: There is a mistake in stitch count after the heel turn, on page 4, Next Row. It has been corrected. (This should not have affected your ability to knit the sock.) 12/28/21

I’m always looking for inspiration from other hand crafts. The beauty of traditional pinwheel quilts caught my eye as a sock-worthy, graphic pattern that would translate beautifully into stranded knitting. I was delighted to discover that the finished socks also resemble the fragmented beauty of stained glass windows!

Knit cuff down, this design looks far more complicated than it is. The chart is easy to memorize, and the possibilities for color play are endless. Knit them in a palette of your favorite tones, as I did, or create a striking pair out of just two colors!

*Tip: If you measure between sizes, you might be unsure about which size you should knit. For example, if you measure 8.5” / 22 cm, do you knit the size M or the size L? The answer can be found in your gauge! If you are a tight knitter, go with the bigger size. If you are a loose knitter, go with the smaller size.*

> The days are becoming short and gray - just the time to knit up some bright socks that make you want to dance! These socks are named for the wildflower purl stitch pattern (from Barbara Walker's Second Treasury of Knitting Patterns. The stitch pattern is easy to memorize and very forgiving - if you do make a mistake, it will be practically invisible, especially with variegated yarn. If you do use variegated yarn, you will get an impressionist effect of single-color wildflowers on a multi-colored background.

You can re-size these socks to fit any wearer, just keep in mind that the stitch pattern requires a multiple of 8 st when knit in the round.

The entire Series is out and published! 

Looking for a little more than a vanilla sock for your striping sock yarn? Summer Stripes Sock Series patterns are perfect for you! 

Frontage Road is one of a four part sock series that works perfectly with self-striping sock yarn. This design is a simple two row repeat using knits and purls that is excellent for the first time sock knitter. Or the knitter looking for a pattern that looks great with stripes. 

I have included where to insert a contrast heel flap if it is desired but it's not necessary. Linked in the pattern are two different tutorials for kitchener stitch (these are outside sources and not my own). 

I used two skeins of Felici, about 66 grams of yarn for a women's size 8.5 US foot.

These socks are an homage to the scene in the BBC television production of *4:50 from Paddington* in which Miss Marple and her friend Mrs McGillicuddy conspire to find a body on the estate of Rutherford Hall—with the aid of a nip of Damson Gin. 

The all-over dots, or “damsons”, give the socks some texture, while the picot edged cuff gives these socks a feminine finishing touch. They are knit toe up, with a short row heel. The picot edge is created from a folded cuff, that is ribbed on the inside for elasticity, and sewn down on the inside.

**Sizes**
Size is based on circumference, not length.To stay on your foot, socks need negative ease. Pick a size about 1 inch or 2.5cm less than the circumference of your ankle/foot. The length is adjustable.

I’ve been interested in tiling (or allover) patterns for quite a while. Most recently, I have focused on the ones that do not display as horizontal as Fair Isle and Nordic colorwork patterns do. I find they have a quite different feel to them that is anything but static. Here’s one of my simplest non-horizontal patterns: after I knit it up I decided it looked like confetti so I named these my **Birthday Party Socks**.

Sugar, spice, and everything nice?! That’s what gingerbread homes are made of!

Find a toasty hue of yarn that matches your favorite gingerbread recipe, then pick your favorite candy-colored yarn to garnish your gingerbread with all the trimmings. Of course, no gingerbread home is complete without luscious drips of thick, sweet icing!

The Iced Gingerbread Socks feature a simple and meditative stitch pattern that is perfect for cozy holiday nights by the fire or a festive movie. A thoughtfully crafted slip-stitch pattern produces the perfect icing drip transition between the candy-inspired contrasting cuff, heel, and toes. An Eye of Partridge heel produces a texture that allows your contrasting yarn to pop in a unique and unexpected way. Feeling extra inspiration? Embroider additional candy-inspired decorations on your socks!

Suggested Yarn Colors:

MC: A brown or tan, solid, semi-solid, or tonal yarn that makes your mouth water for the snap of a crisp gingerbread cookie.
CC1: A colorful, variegated, and/or speckled yarn that reminds you of whatever sugary sweets would adorn your gingerbread home. Note: A more saturated color palette will provide the best contrast to both the MC and CC2.
CC2: A pure white or off-white yarn.

1229404,Oregon Trail Socks,Megan-Anne Llama,5.17,36.0,4.0,,450.0,"Welcome to the Geek-A-Long 2022!!!! This year we are going to let our freak-flags and freak-toes fly with some incredible socks inspired by our favorite classic video games. The Geek-A-Long is an MKAL, which means you will know generally what you are making but we won't reveal the final pictures until the project completes. 

This year we are doing several shorter sock MKALs rather than one huge blanket or sweater, and we are starting the year off with The Oregon Trail! The pattern will be released in 5 installments/clues: 

3/27/2022 - [Project Sheet and Gauge Swatch][1]
4/3/2022 - [Leg 1][2]
4/10/2022 - [Foot 1][3]
4/17/2022 - [Leg 2][4]
4/24/2022 - [Foot 2][5]
5/1/2022 - [Full Pattern available for download][6]
By adding this pattern to your library you will get the weekly clues when they publish each Sunday. The first week of each pair in the 2022 year-of-the-sock will be a project sheet that contains the yarn, needle, and gauge information you will need to cast on the following week. 

First imagined in the Winter of 2013, the Geek-A-Long (GAL) was born from unrestrained idealism and way too much coffee. The idea was ridiculous: Release a new pattern every week all year, based on pop-culture nerdiness. At the end of the year, we would join 48 double-sided squares together to make a massive blanket. Our Fandom Opus would be sent to the Child’s Play Charity Dinner Auction in Seattle, and the proceeds of the sale would go towards providing video games and other entertainment to children in hospitals and domestic violence shelters.

When Megan-Anne cast on that first square, she had no idea what the GAL would turn into. Seven years, seven blankets, and nearly 300 squares later, the Geek-A-Long has grown far beyond us. The community has grown each year and based on our square download statistics there are GAL knitters in every corner of the world. Your generosity is astounding. The GAL community has raised over $10,000 for Child’s play with individual donations and proceeds raised from the sale of the auctioned blankets.

We wanted to do something to make 2020 memorable. Admittedly, that decision was made in 2019, and 2020 doesn’t need help standing out. Still, we wanted to shake things up. When Megan-Anne finished knitting that first blanket in 2014, we never imagined we’d still be making them in 2020. We are blown away by how much love and support the project has gotten and couldn’t have predicted it. We want you to see [Eight Bit][7], [On Board][8], and now these socks for what they are: a love letter from us to the entire GAL community. <3

Pull out the scraps.  Beginning's end is designed to utilize scrap yarns with alternating color work stripes.  A faux seam on the back of the leg hides the jog and outlines the increases for the Strong heel.  

When using scrap yarns, the color pattern will show best when one color is consistently light and the other color is consistently dark.  

Each stripe will use about 8-10 yards / 7.5-9 meters.  Gusset stripes will use about 11-14 yards / 9.5-13 meters.  The heel turn will use about 10-14 yards / 9-13 meters.

I wanted to create a pair of striped socks where there was no color jog when you change colors.  These socks make that happen, while the slipped stitch pattern lets both colors shine.  Since these socks mirror each other, you will need to knit both a right sock and a left sock.  I recommend knitting the right sock first, as learning the pattern is slightly more intuitive this way.  

Directions are included for socks with both a standard length leg as well as shortie socks.

A video tutorial is included to show the effortless and invisible color changes while striping your two yarns together.

These patterns are meant for times when you want a mostly mindless knitting project you can pick up and put down easily, but also want something a little more interesting than a plain vanilla sock - hence, the ""Vanilla Sundae"" name. All 6 patterns are also available together in an ebook for the best total price! The ebook also comes with a **BONUS 15-page Vanilla Sock Recipe** written for both cuff-down and toe up constructions, an expanded 12 sizes, guidance on how to adjust sizing for your own stitch and round gauge, as well as plenty of other tips so that you can create handknit socks you will actually wear! I hope you enjoy these sock patterns, and happy knitting!

The color of the yarn, plus the textured lines on the top of the foot, made me think of the waves of color running through a swirl of rainbow sherbet! These socks feature an easy panel texture on the front of the foot and leg, which will work especially well for a variegated or semisolid yarn. Three children sizes and four adult sizes are included. 

**Construction**
Socks are knit toe-up. After the toe increases are done, a texture pattern is worked on the top of the foot with stockinette stitch on the bottom, until the heel is reached. The heel is worked with a Fleegle Heel. Once the heel is done, the texture pattern is resumed up the front of the leg, and is finished with a 1x1 ribbed cuff. You can optionally use a CC for the cuff as shown in the sample.

**Yarn**
You can make these all in one color or use a contrast color for the toe and/or cuff (sample shows CC on the cuff). 

MC: TeenyButton Studio Soft Sock, 100g / 463 yards; 75% SW Merino, 25% Nylon in Heartstopper. For the adult sample I alternated strands to reduce pooling (I split one skein into two balls).

*Note* After finishing the heel flap and beginning to work in the round again, the pattern suggests knitting the back of the leg in stockinet stitch until the front of the leg pattern starts a new repeat.  Alternatively you can start the back of the leg at the same row as the front of the leg.  This may give you only a partial rose, but may be preferable to plain stockinet rows.  Your choice :-)

The instant I saw this stitch pattern, I fell in love! The strong, sinuous lines just beckoned to be made into a pair of socks.

I had just dyed up several new colorways, and the variegated one pictured begged to be knit in this pattern. After knitting the socks, top down, the pattern continued to enchant me, and I just had to see what they would look like in a ‘Just About’ solid yarn.

I am thrilled with the way the lines carve out their pattern and travel down the leg and foot.

I particularly like the one twisted knit stitch on the sides that flows out of the pattern and down the foot to visually separate the top of the foot from the bottom. The stitch pattern to me suggests hourglass timers, and thus the name.

Severus Snape is an often disliked and more often misunderstood character from J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter Series.  Snape, as he is often simply referred to, is a very complex character that is woven into every facet of the story – both the good and the bad.  This particular stitch pattern reminded me of the competing sides that Snape glides through effortlessly while at the same time, complimenting each other and creating a depth of fabric.

Someone just pointed out to me that the toe decreasing instructions are very vague if you are not familiar with sock decreasing. Here is what you should do:

Where it says to work a decrease round it means you start a standard toe decrease. To do this you would separate the stitches so you have 32 and 32 on your needles and make sure they are placed across your foot however you want the toe to line up.

For the decrease round, knit from your starting point (it may have changed once you lined up the toes) until you are within 3 sts of one of your edges, then depending on which edge you come to first you would K2tog, K1 or K1, SSK. Then do this for the other three edges and remember which side you started on because you will always start on that side for the rest of the decreases.

I saw a chevron pattern in one of my stitch pattern books and thought it would be fun to see the stripes zig zag, and so the pattern was born. It's an incredibly easy pattern with only 2 rows to do, and one of them is knit all stitches around! The pattern is easily memorized and is great travel knitting. 

Because the chevrons pull the stitches a bit tight, go up a needle size from what you normally would use. My regular sock needle size is a US 1 (2.25 mm), so that's why this calls for US 1.5 (2.5 mm). If your usually sock needle size is already 1.5 (2.5 mm) go up to a US 2 (2.75 mm).

Even thought it's written as toe up, you could easily knit this cuff down because the chevrons will look the same both ways.

Woolly Mammoth Fibre Co. Natural Sock, 1 skein in the “Peony” colorway

**Needles** 
2.25 mm/US 1 needles or whatever size needed to get gauge

**Gauge** 
8 stitches x 12 rows = 1 in or 2.5 cm in stockinette in the round, blocked 

**Sizes** 
Size is based on circumference, not length.To stay on your foot, socks need negative ease. Pick a size about 1 inch or 2.5 cm less than the circumference of your foot. The length is adjustable.
S: 6.25 in or 16 cm 
M: 7.5 in or 19 cm 
L: 8.75 in or 22 cm

The seed stitch and lace expand width-wise more than stockinette does, so if you’re between sizes I recommend picking the smaller size. If you find that your gauge is much looser than you'd like for the leg, I'd also recommend knitting the leg with a smaller needle and returning to a larger needle for the heel, foot and toe.

I love finding clever ways to play with the typical components of a toe-up or top-down sock. The gusset is one element that stands out from the rest of the sock, and many sock knitters dread this part.

This sock embraces the gusset as a design feature and is actually the highlight of this footwear! Working from the toe-up, twisted ribbing cuts its way through stockinette to the top of the instep where the lace gusset is inserted. Yarnovers without matching decreases create an expanding gusset on the top of the foot, rather than hidden along the sides. After the heel, the lace works its way seamlessly up the leg of the sock, perfectly matching the unique gusset.

It's an entertaining knit that will keep you on your toes and have you showing off a gusset that is hidden in Plain Sight!

This pattern is appropriate for an intermediate level knitter familiar with fair isle knitting. The gusset has some fairly explicit instructions that a beginner would likely struggle with. Expert knitters will find the pattern interesting as well, and it should be a quick and fun knit for them.

Originally published in Knotions, November 2023 Sock Issue, the Dottie Socks are now available in my Ravelry Store! Included in the pattern is now directions for a shortie sock version!

When I designed the Dottie Socks, I was envisioning a sock with bright, happy colors and something that would be relaxing to knit. We have a tradition in our family to always bake a homemade decorated cake for each other’s birthdays. Throughout the years, I have decorated many colorful cakes, spending lots of time piping different colors of frosting and using a variety of sprinkles and candy to bring joy to my family’s birthdays. Dottie reminded me of that joy with the sprinkle of dots and blocks of color.

This top down sock design features a 1x1 twisted ribbed cuff in the first contrasting color. A band of a mosaic dots pattern is worked using three colors but only one color per row. The sock is then continued in stockinette until the heel flap. The heel flap and turn of the heel are worked in a second contrasting color. The main color is then used again to work the gusset and continued until right before the toe when another band of the mosaic dots pattern is worked around the foot. Finally, the second contrasting color is used to finish the toe.

Paired with a skirt, trousers, or jeans, it grabs all the attention; show it off with hi-tops or high heels! Classic sock construction with a flap heel and grafted toe allows the knitter’s attention to focus on the entertaining twist stitch motif, but don’t be afraid to personalize the method for a custom fit or to suit your knitterly preferences. The carved texture has so much depth and definition that even the softest yarn will produce a substantial, structured sock that holds its shape.

Errata as of May 25th:
Stretchy Hexagon Round 2 after the closed square bracket it reads: “4 times - 12 stitches decreased.” Since the Hexagons are worked on 3 needles with the fourth needle knitting, it must read “3 times - 12 stitches decreased.” You have to repeat three times, not four times.

I love to wear handknit socks in the fall, and I love to knit small pattern repeats; Solidago combines these two loves. I flipped through my own book 200 Fair Isle Motifs: A Knitter's Directory, to find a perfect 8-stitch pattern repeat. For color, I chose the hues of a fall meadow.

The colorwork looks more complex than it actually is, employing only 4 colors and never more than two in any round, ideal for those new to Fair Isle knitting and interesting enough for more experienced knitters. Half the fun is trying out different colorways and socks are the perfect vehicle for this.

I used beautiful Harrisville American Shetland yarn which comes in a million fabulous colors. Since the skeins are large, you'll have yarn left over, perfect for working another pair with a different color arrangement, see what you can come up with! Solidago is the Latin term for the goldenrod plant, whose name means, ""to strengthen or make whole"". May your new socks make you strong!

Yarn used:
Harrisville American Shetland [100% Pure Virgin Wool; 217/m per 50g skein]	
spacer [MC] gold: #61 Goldenrod; 1 [2, 2] skein(s)
spacer [CC1] maroon: #36 Garnet; 1 [1, 1, 1] skein
spacer [CC2] red: #63 Scarlet; 1 [1, 1, 1] skein
spacer [CC3] pale yellow:#6 Cornsilk; 1 [1, 1, 1] skein


For pattern color amounts:
**Hi - since you asked...I knit, ripped and measured the Fair Isle section of my Solidago socks. Based on these measurements I think we're safe to allow:**

CC1: S 18 yds, M 19 yds, L 20 yds
CC2: S 8 yds, M 9 yds, L 10 yds
CC3: S 8 yds, M 9 yds, L 10 yds

or meters if you like:

CC1: S 16.5m, M 17.5m, L 18.5m
CC2: S 7.5, M 8.5m, L 9.5m
CC2: S 7.5, M 8.5m, L 9.5m

I've rounded up, so you may use less...but with the mysteries of individual knitting styles, you may use more, but I don't think you will. If it did happen, you could substitute a different color and have a very unique and envy worthy pair of socks!",,341,872,4.67,S-M-L,Fingering
717781,Bespoke Vanilla Socks,Melissa Lund,2.88,32.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,400.0,"This is my go-to pattern for variegated or self-striping sock yarn with contrasting heels and toes.  The construction is cuff-down, with an eye of partridge heel and anatomically correct toes (for those of us with more angled toes) - so this pattern will result in defined left and right socks.  The pattern is written for two circular needles, but if you have some experience with sock knitting, feel free to use the needle of your choice.

Ingredients:
Main color yarn: any fingering weight sock yarn, 250-350 yards
Contrasting color yarn: any fingering/heavy fingering weight sock yarn, approx. 50-60 yards
(Your yarn mileage will really vary here, depending on how long you like your sock leg, how long your feet are, etc.  One 100g skein of sock yarn (400-437 yards) will typically be enough to make a pair of regular length women’s socks, accounting for some variation in foot length.  I wear a US 7.5 and usually use about 250 yards of MC yarn.)
Needles: two 16” circular needles in US 1 or 1.5 (2.25 or 2.5 mm), or as needed to get gauge
Crochet hook (optional)
Tapestry needle

Originally a summer mystery knit along, **Beach Chair Socks** is a fun project sure to keep you engaged and excited to knit, as although the design uses the same colors and stitches in both socks, **THE SOCKS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!** No worry about second-sock syndrome! 
For this reason, it is not encouraged to knit two socks at a time, unless you plan to knit two pairs. Two separate sock patterns are included in the design. 

The pattern is perfect for a new sock knitter (experience with double-pointed needles is required) and is also fun for an advanced knitter as the colors and stitches change often.

The socks are knit in the round, cuff down, and directions are written for double-pointed needles; however any technique can be used by an experienced sock-knitter who may prefer the magic loop method.

There is a little cable, lace, and other simple stitches, and an easy short row heel with both detailed written instructions and color charts.

You will need at least 100 yards of four colors:
One Neutral, one pop, one light tone and one dark tone.

  for round 2 of Sock Madness?
  
  Traditional ethnic patterns intrigue
  me and I am always on the lookout for
  new ones that can be adapted for
  knitting. I came across this pattern
  (in a larger stitch count version)
  thirty years ago in a Dover reprint
  publication of 17th century
  Transylvanian needlepoint patterns. I
  was immediately interested in this
  particular pattern with its strong
  diagonal lines plus alternating dark
  and light triangles. To get the
  pattern down to a manageable size that
  was suitable for socks, I had to shrink
  it down to a 12 stitch repeat that is
  worked in a standard Fair Isle manner.
  Since my contrasting yarn color way
  reminded me of a deeply shaded forest
  glade and the pattern is a very old
  one, I have named these socks: Echoes
  from a Transylvanian Forest. 
  
  This top down sock employs two
  different Fair Isle patterns. A
  standard heel flap is made with side
  gussets. Stitch count is generous to
  allow for the natural pulling in of a
  Fair Isle fabric—no need to size up.
  Since they are knit throughout with 2
  strands they are thick and cushy.

*Yarn selection suggestions: you will need at least two colors of yarn: a solid black and a brightly contrasting colored yarn (can be either a solid color or multicolored). As an alternative and for a striking different look, multiple contrasting solid colors can also be used in addition to the black, each one used for a single repeat of Pattern 2 (some good stash busting potential!).*

Reminiscent of picket fences and garden gates, these simple textured socks will keep your feet toasty while you nibble on lettuce, French beans, and radishes. 

**Size and Gauge:**
• This pattern includes three sizes: 56-stitch, 64-stitch, and 72-stitch, which will fit most adults. To adjust fit, go up or down a needle size based on your preferences.
• Approximately 8 stitches per inch.

**Needles:**
• I used 2.25mm (US size 1) needles, but please use whichever size of sock needles works for you.
• I used 32-inch-long circular needles for magic loop.

**Yarn:**
• Any fingering weight (1: superfine) yarn, or sock yarn, that includes nylon will work for this pattern.
• You will need between 250-400 yards, depending on the size you make.
• I used a heavy fingering weight, so I sized down. 

The (56-stitch) sample I made used:
•	Little Skein in the Big Wool, Smooth Sock (fingering weight, 3 ply, 400 yards per 115g skein, 80% superwash merino wool and 20% nylon), in the colorway “Green Gables.”
•	 280 yards, 80g, used.

**Notions:**
• Tapestry needle

**Skills Needed:**
Perfect for the adventurous beginner, this pattern utilizes:
• Knitting and purling
• Increasing and decreasing
• Textured stitches
• Eye of partridge heel flap and gusset

We start with a 2x2 ribbed cuff. It’s the most stretchy and always looks better than the open laddering that comes with 1x1 rib. The stripes begin on the leg, and despite the heel flap and gusset, continue uninterrupted on the top of the foot all the way down. The socks are completed with a rounded toe for a sweet touch.

I wanted to create a pattern that would look good not only in solid colors, but that could incorporate a multicolored or speckled yarn and still have the design be apparent.  I am pleased to say that Slipzag is the result!

Then I started playing with the idea of a pattern that could also work for sock sets.  That’s when the partial Slipzag was born.  If you have a sock set that has a strong contrasting mini, you can use that to knit the cuff and leg pattern on the partial Slipzag.  If your sock set comes with two minis, you can use the second mini for the contrast toe.  If you want the cuff/leg and toe to match, if you dig into your leftovers and find one that is about 25-30g, you’ll have plenty to do that.

I also thought it would be fun to carry the pattern throughout the entire leg and foot, and that’s when the full Slipzag was created. This is great to use with two half skeins (about 50g each) that contrast well.

ENTER : A Better Ribbed Sock!! 

The combination of 2x2 and 3x2 ribbing creates a pattern that is easy to memorize, while still being fun and engaging to knit. 

This pattern is written for toe up socks, with a heel flap and gusset. A link to a calculator for gusset increases is provided in the pattern. 

While stitch gauge is not really important for this pattern (ribbing is very forgiving!), you will need to measure your row gauge to know where to start your increases. This is super easy! Don't be intimidated by the measuring tape!

Only two size circumferences are written in the pattern (64 stitches and 72 stitches) but again, this ribbed fabric will stretch to accommodate a vast majority of the feet you knit for! And since the socks are knit toe up, the foot length and leg length are completely customizable.

Each size has its own PDF download for ease of reading. Please ensure you are reading the pattern for the size you intend to make :)

You will need:
(1) 100g skein of sock yarn
A 32"" or longer circular needle for magic loop, in your preferred sock needle size
A tapestry needle for weaving in ends
A ruler or measuring tape for checking your row gauge

The red sample socks (size medium) took 75g of Knomad Eggshell, which is approximately 328 yards.
The grey sample socks (size medium) took 85g of Knit Picks Hawthorne, which is approximately 303 yards.

The yardage you use for this project depends on your gauge, shoe size, and how long you knit the leg. For most feet, a single 100g skein of sock yarn is more than enough.

Design Detail: the ribbing on the cuff flows naturally into the stitch patterns on the leg.

**IMPORTANT! There are two corrections to the pattern  instructions. 

**First on the cuff for size L: the next to last sentence  in the cuff section should read, ""On the last row of ribbing, stop after stitch 12 (13) on Needle #4."" So you will work 13 stitches on needle #4 for size L, *not* 12 stitches (you do work 12 stitches on needle #4 for size M).

**Second, Round 2 instructions for the gusset are missing. Please insert them after the instructions for Round 1 in the section titles ""shape gussets."" The directions should read, “Needles 1 & 4: knit all sts; Needles 2 & 3: work top of foot in pattern as established.”**

Pattern Notes: 
- skill level: Intermediate. Knitting in the round, sock knitting, and multiple chart reading experience helpful. 
- techniques: Learn to cable without a cable needle.
- method: Knit from the cuff down with a heel flap, round heel and wedge toe. Instructions are for dpn’s.
- yarn choice: Solid or near-solid yarns are best; dramatically colored yarn will obscure the texture. Additional yarn may be needed for larger size.
- suggestion given for knitting a smaller size.

This sock pattern was inspired by a guernsey that particularly impressed Gladys Thompson, author of the book, [Patterns for Guernseys, Jerseys & Arans](book) with its longevity. At the time she gathered material for her book, that guernsey had been in constant wear for over forty years, including the WWII years when the guernsey’s owner served in the British Navy!  The double moss stitch diamonds and cables on this sock are smaller in scale than those of the guernsey, but the overall appearance is in keeping with the Filey guernsey.

**Sybaritic** adjective *fond of luxury or pleasure, self-indulgent*

These really are shamelessly feminine and marvelously indulgent.  The cuff is embossed with an intricate leaf pattern that flows beautifully into the leg.  One lone stem trails down your leg and wraps itself around your ankle (hiding the gusset as it goes) and ends in a final leaf on the top of your foot.

I can't think of anything more lovely!

They're written in two sizes (64 and 72 stitch cast ons), and you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the sock. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a sturdy sock fabric with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 7, 8, or 9 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for the size you need. With that range of sizes and gauges, the socks will fit a foot (measured around the ball of the foot) between 7.75 and 11.25 inches (with lots of points in between).

http://www.palella.net/patterns/TeasSocks.pdf

This is a combination of my Grandmother’s and other friends’ patterns with some modifications of my own.

The reason I love this pattern so much is that it’s easy to memorize, and after you’ve made a pair or two of socks, you will never have to look for the pattern again, unless you’re sharing it with someone.
As I go along, I will put little helpful hints on the sides, to help you memorize the pattern easier. You will recognize them by the symbol ▶. There is also a short version of the pattern further below.

I’ve knitted many, many socks over the years and my favorite yarn is Regia 4ply with five 2.5mm - 2.75mm double pointed needles. In my experience and the following pattern, 100g/420m of Regia yarn are enough to make a pair of socks in S, M, and L size. XL with a little shorter leg.

You can adjust this pattern easily, should you use thicker yarn. For Regia 6ply, I go one size smaller.

All beginnings are hard. The first few rows feel a little awkward, especially if you’ve never used five double pointed needles, but don’t worry, it gets easier with every row!
It is also super easy to modify the pattern and work in stockinette stitch only, with 10 rows of k1p1 in the beginning, or to add cables. Possibilities are endless, once you get the hang of how to create socks.

885614,Intermingle,Rich Ensor,4.06,36.0,4.0,In pattern,,"With winter fast approaching, I start thinking about the delights of chunky cabled sweaters. The only downside of heavily cabled sweaters is that they can take a long time to knit. Socks on the other hand, are a much faster knit. Granted, chunky cables and socks don't often play well together. Cables tend to absorb negative ease, and too many chunky cables on the instep can make squeezing a sock into a shoe a bit of a challenge.

Intermingle addresses both of these issues. The cable appears as one panel surrounded by stockinette stitches. This allows the stockinette to provide the much-needed negative ease. Additionally, the cable gets split in half at the instep, so the sock isn't too bulky when worn inside of shoes. The cables are mirrored, just to keep things interesting.

919483,Karyn's Toe Up Sock Recipe,Knit Hero,0.0,32.0,4.0,,450.0,"Small: 7-8"" foot circumference
Medium: 8-9"" foot circumference
Large: 9-10"" foot circumference 

These socks are intended to be worn fitted or with a small amount of negative ease; choose a size that is within the range of your foot circumference. 

While this pattern is written to fit the average adult using fingering weight yarn, I have included notes to customize this pattern in order to use any weight yarn for any size foot: bitty babies through ginormous. 

This pattern is written using a 32-40"" circular needle for magic loop, but two 16-24"" circular needles could be used as well. 

Instructions are included for contrasting heel and toe if desired. 

This pattern includes video support for the cast on, all steps of the heel turn, and the bind off.

After knitting my way through a myriad of different sock patterns, I finally designed what I truly think is the ideal sock pattern: perfectly fitting and easy to customize. Knit toe-up starting with Judy's Magic Cast On, this pattern includes a mini-heel flap before working the short-row heel, which enables these toe-up socks to fit even the highest in-step.

Looking for a little more than a vanilla sock for your striping sock yarn? Summer Stripes Sock Series patterns are perfect for you!

Great Stones works perfectly with self-striping sock yarn. This design is a simple rib using knits and purls that is excellent for the first time sock knitter. Or the knitter looking for a pattern that looks great with stripes.

I have included where to insert a contrast heel flap if it is desired but it’s not necessary. Linked in the pattern is a tutorial for kitchener stitch (outside source, not my own).

1014660,Diamond Duality,Liz Harris,4.65,36.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,510.0,"*This pattern was Round 1 of Sock Madness 14 in 2020.* 

I'm always on the lookout for inspiration to create a new type of pattern or technique and these socks are no exception. This two color stranded colorwork pattern that grades from mostly blue to mostly yellow was originally adapted from a solid color historical weaving pattern with the diamonds showing up as a subtle texture (on a much smaller scale, of course). The two colors of diamonds wax and wane into each other but are still diamonds—hence the name Diamond Duality.

*This top down sock employs two different stranded colorwork patterns which are given as charts **only**. A standard heel flap is made with side gussets. Stitch count is generous to allow for the natural pulling in of a stranded fabric—no need to size up. 

Yarn color suggestions: you will need two colors of yarn: a dark solid and a light solid that is strongly  contrasting to the first color. Only solid, heathers or lightly tonal colors (as shown here) that contrast with each other are appropriate. Variegated or self-striping yarn will obscure the pattern. Dark to light (as shown) or the reverse of light to dark are both acceptable.*

Here is my go-to recipe for top down socks. I have added many sizes for you to use this pattern for many different sized feet. This is a great starting point for fingering weight socks.

This is a top down, fingering weight sock with a garter-edge traditional heel flap. It is worked using magic loop; needle 1 will be front of foot/instep and leg, and needle 2 will be back of the foot, leg and heel.

These can be made with one color, or two depending on size knitted and length of foot/leg. You can get 2 pairs of shortie socks out of 100g sock yarn for sizes 1-4, or a full length sock with 100g for sizes 1-7, if making larger you may need a bigger skein or a contrast color. *(If you have larger calves and are knitting tall socks [crew not shorties], go up a needle size for the cuff, noted below).

The two sample pairs were knit from a 100g skein of Shirley Brian Yarns Deconstructed Fade Sock Set, 382 yds used total (191 yds per pair) size 4.

Sizes:

Size 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 48 (52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80) sts around.

Actual sock circumference: 6 (6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10)”

To Fit: 7 (7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11)” around ball of foot. You want your sock to have about 10% negative ease around and 10% negative ease for length.

Yarn: Any fingering weight sock yarn will do for this pattern. Feel free to add contrasting heels/toes/cuffs.",2.5,15,7,0.0,"Size 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 48 (52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80) sts around.",Light Fingering

They feature contrasting textures and yarns to create a springtime knitting experience you can practically smell in the air. The engaging contrast floral lace texture is easy to memorize and soothing to knit, while the ribbed leg and foot sections give a beautiful and cozy fit. The delicate stockinette cuff is sweet and adds the perfect whimsical touch for perfect socks to wear on a walk to the botanical gardens, while the hidden fold over ribbed facing on the inside achieves a snug fit. Enjoy knitting these delightful socks in your favorite yarn colorway to create the most perfect floral socks for you.

Due to the nature of the colorwork pattern, the patterned heel can only be worked in one spot. Foot length options are based on pattern row gauge.

This pattern provides instructions for an afterthought heel. If you would like to substitute a different heel, simply omit the heel instructions, and substitute your chosen heel after completing the leg.

This pattern is written for sizes small(medium, large) and are designed to fit a 7(8, 9) inch foot circumference. Please note that sock fabric has a lot of stretch, and each size will realistically fit 6-8(7-9, 8-10) inch feet.

Lemme Socks start with a beaded stitch I’ve nicknamed the Lemme stitch.  It’s curvy and swirly and adds a playful glimmer to your ankle!

**[The Lemme Stitch has a short and fab tutorial here.][2]**

Subtle ribbing flows down along the top of the foot, making it easy to adjust the length of the sock before finishing it off with a classic toe. Lemme tell you, these are a FUN knit!

*Polar Arc* is engineered specifically for gradient and self striping yarns. The structure exploits the properties of fabric worked on the bias and reinforced heel stitch to create a heel *without a heel turn*. Unlike with other sock patterns, you don’t get a break in hue or pattern across the instep because he heel is completely integrated with the body of the sock.

This sock is worked **top down**. The [toe-up pattern][2] is sold separately, or you can buy both of them together in the eBook [Polar ARChitecture][3].

This pattern is structurally identical to the toe-up version with one small exception: at the very end of the arch, just before the toe, this pattern includes an additional 3(3, 5, 7) rounds of shaping. If a precise match with toe up is desired, simply skip these rounds and go directly to working the toe.

This pattern consists of 5 separate files: One file for each size (S, M, L, XL) and one file for half-sizes. When you purchase the pattern you get all of these files. Finished circumferences range from 6.5 to 10 inches.

Nobody can tell you what to do... you make your own rules! These striped socks use three (or more) colors, creatively put together to show off every shade of your personality. Make them match or mix them up-- it’s entirely up to you. Worked toe-up, these socks feature a German Short Row heel, perfectly suited for working a coordinating yarn without breaking up the color pattern. Alternating colors make for a playful design, easily adjustable to use as many colors as you want. Grab your yarn and needles... you’re Going on Stripes!

This pattern includes a photo tutorial for working German Short Rows.

*“It was as if a wall stood up between them and the sky... Then up came the sun, and at its first rising they saw it through the wall and it turned into wonderful rainbow colours.” - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader*

The Narnian sailors arrive at the end of the world to find a Silver Sea filled with lilies and sunlight refracted into rainbows by a giant wave. These top-down socks use stranded colorwork to create their own fractal design. Pair your favorite Countess Ablaze variegated with a semi-solid for stunning results. The design is anchored by a solid cuff, heel, and toe, while clever details such as an eye-of-the-partridge heel and a unique gusset make these socks as fun to knit as they are to wear. This flashy footwear is ready to travel to the end of the world... and beyond!

Warm-up sock for Sock Madness 12.    

Knit top down with a bobbled trimmed, ribbed cuff, the lace pattern plays with the stripes to form fun waves of color. The short row heel (using shadow wraps) with a mini gusset  accommodates those with a higher instep who might otherwise have trouble with the fit of a traditional short row heel.

A symphony of cables, lace, and wale stitches make up this delicate pair of socks inspired by ornamental gables and trusses. Decorating the ankle are pillars of chevron lace — flanked by serpentine wale stitches and mirrored cables — that continue to the top of the foot while branching out at the back of the ankle to accommodate a slipped-stitch heel flap. A short row heel turn ensures comfortable fit; double decreases shape the gusset for functional grace; and a round toe completes the prim picture. Worked in worsted-spun Peerie, Hazelfern is a luxurious treat to wear when lounging at home, but is also strong and durable for afternoon strolls.

***Stay Cozy House Socks*** are all about ultimate comfort. At a DK / light worsted weight, these socks will keep your feet warm & cozy on a chilly day.

This pattern features texture stripes of varying rib stitches – emphasized by the use of Suri or mohair held together with the main color, at alternating sections. Stay Cozy House Socks are worked from the cuff-down with a heel flap and gusset and are designed to be knit in two strands of fingering weight yarn, held together throughout. The addition of a single strand of Suri or Mohair further emphasizes the “stripe” design of the varying rib stitch patterns, while also providing extra warmth, durability and maximizing the cozy factor!

*“Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose? I thought it was only raspberry cordial. Oh, please don’t say that you won’t let Diana play with me any more.” 
– Anne Shirley, Anne of Green Gables*

Anne was delighted to invite dear Diana to tea, and was given special permission to treat her to raspberry cordial. Little did she know, what she actually served was currant wine, sending Diana home drunk. These socks begin at the toe, with splashes of lace working their way up the front of the sock. The lace pattern is predictable and easy to memorize, ending with bubbles of ribbing floating up the cuff. Knit up quickly with a luxurious sportweight yarn, you may find these socks surprisingly intoxicating to knit!

*“The Volturi... are the closest thing our world has to a royal family... you don’t  irritate the Volturi... unless you want to die...”– Edward Cullen, New Moon*

The Volturi are a rich and powerful family of vampires who feast upon humans, while maintaining their position as the tyrants of the vampire world. These top-down socks feature a Baroque-inspired lace detail that would be suitable for royalty. The back of the leg is worked in 3x1 ribbing all the way down the heel to ensure a snug fit.

A Collaboration with Suburban Stitcher Yarns- available here: [SS website][1]

>I am a fan of a bright sock. They’re bold. -Matt Smith, English actor

Several years ago, I saw more tweed yarn available from Indie Dyers at shows around the US, but it wasn’t as common to find bright colored tweed. Until I saw some at Rhinebeck and bought several bright colors. Now years later, I have fallen down the DK Tweed rabbit hole and designed these socks as a collaboration with Dianne of Suburban Stitcher yarns and thought I should also include fingering weight socks as well. Named for Pears as this collection resembles the lovely colors of a variety of pears but also because everyone loves a little play on words, especially a former English teacher. Thus, the Pears of Socks Collection. But please, choose some bright colored tweed yarn and cast on!

Pattern notes: Written for both DK and Fingering weight yarns, this collection includes ‘top-down’ socks, cast on at the cuff, then worked in the round on double pointed or circular needles to the heel. The Dutch heel flap is worked back and forth in rows, and then the heel is turned, stitches are picked up along the heel flap, and the work is joined in the round and decreased through a gusset. Each sock in this collection is embellished with an optional pear-shaped button, bead, or charm. 

ERRATA: There is a mistake in stitch count after the heel turn, on page 4, Next Row. It has been corrected. (This should not have affected your ability to knit the sock.) 12/28/21

In December of 2016, I designed my first hat pattern, the Chim Chim-in-ney Hat and through the years I have watched as knitters have made them for their entire families for Christmas cards and family holiday pictures.  Now years later, I have fallen down rabbit hole and designed these socks as a collaboration with Jeanette and George of Sun Valley Fibers. I decided to write them as DK weight for a perfect month of December house sock but would also include fingering weight socks as well. 

Named for their red and white appearance of bricks these socks are also a nod to Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke, probably the most famous chimney sweep of all time.

Note: Pattern is written for DPNs but feel free to use Magic Loop or 2-circular needles.

NOTIONS: Locking ring or removable stitch marker, tapestry needle, small amount of green wool for making I-cord trim and small amounts of various colors to make Christmas lights for garland trim.

SAMPLE: Adult small sample socks were knit in Sun Valley Fibers Fingering in colorway Checkmate and Antler colorways; and weighed 74 grams and using 296 yds/271 m. (not including garland and lights)

1364361,Watering the Trees Socks,Amanda Stephens,0.0,36.0,4.0,Stockinette Stitch,460.0,"DESIGN INSPIRATION

The idea for the Watering the Trees Socks came about after my six-year-old and two-year-old decided to “water” our backyard trees. This event mostly involved the two of them running around and spraying each other with the garden hose, but they had fun, and the two maple trees in our backyard did get a bit of water.

The design features two mirrored cables to represent our two maple trees, and the textured ribbing makes me think of the streams of water from the garden hose. Carefully placed increases and decreases make the cables in this design really pop while avoiding any guesswork as to which size you should make. Simply choose the stitch count closest to what you would normally use for vanilla socks, and you will be ready to go. This easy-to-memorize pattern will fly off of your needles.

CONSTRUCTION

The Watering the Trees Socks are knit cuff down, beginning with a German Twisted Cast-On and 2x1 rib. The leg and foot of the sock feature columns of mirrored cables and textured ribbing. A traditional heel flap and gusset make for a great overall fit, and a rounded toe and Kitchener stitch finish off the sock.

PATTERN INFORMATION

*Difficulty Rating*
INTERMEDIATE: Project is worked in the round from the cuff down and includes cables, slipped stitches, increases, and decreases. Kitchener stitch is used to finish off the toe.

*Recommended Yarn*
Bare Feet Sock by AT Haynes House, 75% superwash merino wool/25% nylon, 463 yds (423 m) per 3.5 oz (100 g): 1 skein (shown in Just Leaf Me Alone) OR approximately 400 yds (366 m) light fingering to fingering weight yarn.

This pattern will play nicely with any fingering weight merino/merino nylon blend yarn in solid, tonal, or lightly speckled colorways.

*Needles/Notions*

* US #1 (2.25 mm) 32-40” (80-100 cm) circular, or five double pointed needles; OR size needed to obtain gauge.
* Tapestry needle for Kitchener stitch and weaving in ends.
* 4 stitch markers and 1 locking stitch marker.
* Cable needle.

*Gauge*

36 sts and 48 rnds to 4” (10 cm) in stockinette stitch on US #1 (2.25 mm) needles.
Pattern gauge was measured after washing and blocking.

*Sizes Available*
S {M, L, XL} sts

*Finished Measurements*
6.25 {7, 8.25, 9}” (16 {18, 21, 23} cm) leg circumference, unstretched.
Recommended fit is 0.5-1.5” (1-3.8 cm) negative ease.

The model has a ball-of-foot measurement of 8.5” (21.5 cm) and leg measurement of 8.5” (21.5 cm) and is wearing the M size. The model typically wears 64-st or size M vanilla socks.

To get the best fit, choose the size with the CO stitch count closest to what you would CO for vanilla socks using your preferred needle size and sock yarn. The cables are taken into account in the pattern, so you do not need to adjust your size for the cables.

It seems as though the older I get, the faster time goes, and sometimes I wish I had the ability to pause time. My two children seem to change and grow as quickly as the smaller cables on the Pause Time Socks. As I type this, my three-year-old is sitting in my lap, pretending to type and control my finger movements. He won’t be small enough to sit in my lap for long, but I will enjoy the moment for now. The larger central cable takes the shape of an hourglass with longer stretches of stockinette between the cables, reminding us to pause and breathe in the beautiful moments around us.

CONSTRUCTION

The Pause Socks are knit cuff-down, beginning with a German Twisted Cast-On and 2x2 rib. The leg and foot of the sock feature a beautiful trio of short and long cables on the front of the sock and stockinette on the back. A traditional heel flap and gusset make for a great overall fit, and a rounded toe and Kitchener stitch finish off the sock.

To thank all of my followers who support my work by liking, sharing, and knitting my patterns, I decided to make this pattern available for free!

This pattern is Not Quite Vanilla because it has a small band of colorwork after the cuff and before the toe.  There are five different options for the colorwork band, and I’ve also included a mod to knit more than one band on the leg.

I had sock sets with a main color and one or two contrasting colors in mind when creating this pattern.

'Memento' is a cuff-down colorwork sock pattern inspired by my favorite pair of commercial socks, which were a piece of Unus Annus merch purchased sometime before the channel's planned deletion in late 2020. Now that the project is finished and the channel has been gone for years, those socks are pretty beat up and can no longer be re-purchased. But of course, we're knitters, so we find a way! This pattern is designed to be knit with a small amount of negative ease to ensure a snug fit around the foot, and is worked up on 2mm and 2.25mm needles. Three sizes are available, with roughly one inch of difference between each of them. 

If you're still grieving UA, or if you just want a cool pair of contrasting skull socks, Memento is the sock pattern for you! Grab two skeins of highly contrasting sock yarn and be reminded of the endless forward march of time.

The pattern for these socks was donated to the 2017 [Tour de Sock][1] knitting event. Participation fees from Tour de Sock benefit Doctors Without Borders.

**Construction**
Socks are worked cuff to toe in the mosaic knitting technique (using slipped stitches, not stranding). They have a standard heel flap and turn with side gussets. The star toe is closed by cinching (no grafting). Foot length and width are adjustable.

**If reversing colors for two socks:** 170(185,270,220) yards /   160(170,180,200) meters **each** of CC and MC.
Yarn requirements given for leg six inches / 15 cm long.  Solid or tonal dyed yarns in contrasting colors show the pattern best.

**About mosaic knitting**
Here's a good article and tutorial about [Mosaic or Slip-Stitch Knitting][2].

Mosaic knitting creates two-colored patterns by slipping stitches instead of stranding. Each round is worked with only one color at a time. Because there are no long floats, mosaic knitting works up quickly and stretches more than stranded knitting. The fabric sometimes warps to interesting effect.

These beautiful islands are known for their marine life and their relaxed pace. San Juan Islands color work socks are made with one main skein and one mini-skein of contrasting yarn, featuring waves, starfish, and sand patterns. The design utilizes a simple cable heel flap to mimic kelp beds and provide additional durability.

The yarn used in these sock is 1 skein of Dragonfly Fibers Dragon Sock in Beach Glass, dyed exclusively for Fairlight Fibers, and a mini-skein of Nekkid Dragon Sock. Any 4 oz main color skein of sock yarn and 1 oz mini-skein for the contrasting color will work.

*Just north of Ventura, there is a pretty little beach with a wide strip of sand and a good view of the islands. It’s called Solimar, a mashup of “sol y mar,” or “sun and sea.” I like to take my daughter there and let her play in the sand while I get some stitching done. 
 
*I’ve named these socks for that pretty beach and designed them so that the rippling lace looks like the sunlight sparkling on the ocean on a calm day. They feature an easily memorized four-row repeat that looks much more complicated than it is. These socks are great for some peaceful knitting at the beach, on a long road trip, or any time you just need a little peace and quiet.*

**Note: a few corrections have been made in the pattern on the Knitty site.

These socks are knit in the basic cuff-down vanilla-style: cuff, leg, heel, foot, toe... with the simple addition of creating short loops that are knit vertically. After the first set of loops are almost complete, a new set of loops are created off-set from the original loops. The loops alternate between these two locations, pausing for the heel. Then the loops continue on the instep – or can end when desired. Because the yarn is self-striping or a dramatic gradient, the loops contrast with the working yarn. There is an impression of multiple yarns used, but without multiple yarn tails to weave in or balls to juggle.

The pattern has detailed instructions, but this is really a concept sock, so you are able to simply knit your favorite style of sock using the set-up row instructions and the basic premise of off-setting each section of Color Loops without needing to refer to the pattern. I include my favorite sock anatomy with a pre-heel that hugs the ankle, my favorite way to knit the heel flap, a good method of picking up purl bumps for the gusset, and a simple short-row toe. It's a very solid sock construction, but the weight of the sock is surprisingly light considering the color pattern because the vertical loops don't add much bulk. The sock also retains its stretchiness because the Color Loops hang vertically instead of limiting the horizontal stretch as occurs in most colorwork.

I've named these loops Color Loops because they add color (and texture) to knitting projects. Color Loops are easy to knit with and disappear like magic – with neat, vertical designs on both RS and WS. In this design, the stockinette side is the RS, but you'll see in the photos below that I consider them reversible. For demonstrations of Color Loops knitting, please see my YouTube video channel: Color Loops Knitting, and on Ravelry.

*“In the state of Washington, under a near constant cover of clouds and rain, there is a small town named Forks. Population: 3,120 people. This is where I’m moving.” 
– Bella Swan, Twilight*

As a newcomer to Forks, Washington, Bella Swan finds herself taking comfort in the lush landscape and damp, green forests. As Jacob and Edward become important people in her life, she finds that some difficult decisions lay before her and a choice needs to be made. These socks create lace ‘forks,’ beginning at the toe and working their way up the leg of the sock. A reverse stockinette gusset creates a unique texture along the side of the foot. Use a dark yarn for a moody pair, or a bright yarn to make some cheerful spring socks.

> There are only ten minutes in the life of a pear when it is perfect to eat.  --Ralph Waldo Emerson

I love brights! Colorful yarns make my heart happy. When I saw bright colored tweed yarn at the New York Sheep and Wool festival several years ago I was enchanted. I knew I wanted to design socks with easy to knit textured patterns right away.  This collection came out of my desire to knit fun and beginner friendly socks in multiple variations.

Pattern notes: Written for both DK and Fingering weight yarns, this collection includes ‘top-down’ socks cast on at the cuff, then worked in the round on double pointed or circular needles to the heel. The Dutch heel is worked back and forth in rows, and then the heel is turned. Stitches are picked up along the heel flap, the work is joined in the round and the gusset stitches decreased. Each sock in this collection is embellished with an optional pear-shaped button, bead or charm. 

Adult medium sample socks were knit in Little Bean Loves Yarn Confetti Sock (85% SW Merino, 15% Nylon/Neps; 438 yds/400 m/100g) in the colorway: Saffron and weighing 69 grams using 302 yds/276 m.  Yarn is available here: [SHOP][1]

ERRATA: There is a mistake in stitch count after the heel turn, on page 4, Next Row. It has been corrected. (This should not have affected your ability to knit the sock.) There was also a stitch count error on Rows 2-5 of both the LC and RC socks. Pattern was updated 12/28/21

In December of 2016, I designed my first hat pattern, the Chim Chim-in-ney Hat and through the years I have watched as knitters have made them for their entire families for Christmas cards and family holiday pictures.  Now years later, I have fallen down rabbit hole and designed these socks as a collaboration with Jeanette and George of Sun Valley Fibers. I decided to write them as DK weight for a perfect month of December house sock but would also include fingering weight socks as well. 
Named for their red and white appearance of bricks these socks are also a nod to Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke, probably the most famous chimney sweep of all time.

Note: Pattern is written for DPNs but feel free to use Magic Loop or 2-circular needles.

NOTIONS: Locking ring or removable stitch marker, tapestry needle, small amount of green wool for making I-cord trim and small amounts of various colors to make Christmas lights for garland trim

SAMPLE: Adult medium sample socks were knit in Sun Valley Fibers DK in colorway Checkmate and Antler colorways; and weighed 112 grams using 258 yds/236 m. Red yarn used 76 grams/175 yards and White used 36 grams/83 yards.

A lot of work has gone into this pattern to produce the various length and color options and a schedule for each one, with checkboxes to mark off your progress.  (See below for more details.)  But in the end, it is a very pretty, striped vanilla sock, so I am offering this pattern on a **pay what you can** basis, in order to make it affordable for everyone.  I hope that you will enjoy knitting many of these stripey socks.

To pay the full price of $6.00 - use no code
To pay $4.50 - use code BASICALLY25
To pay $3.00 - use code BASICALLY50

I’m calling these the Basically Vanilla Advent Socks, as they are basically a vanilla sock with a fun striping pattern.  Advent not required - leftovers at any time of the year will do fine!

This pattern produces two identical socks when you follow one of the schedules with your choice of 10, 12, or 24 colors, plus an MC used for cuffs/heels/toes.  *Now also includes a 7 color version!*  While you may of course knit one sock at a time, the schedules are designed to let you keep up with both socks at once should you desire - no splitting of skeins or knitting from the inside and outside of a cake required!

The 24 color version will produce a pair of socks in 25 days, while the  7,10, and 12 color versions both have two options for schedules, depending on how fast or slow you’d like to knit the socks.  Whether or not you decide to stick to the schedule, there are checkboxes to mark off your progress.  (Who doesn’t love checking things off?)

All versions have different length options to fit different foot lengths.
24 colors - two length options
12 colors - three length options
10 colors - four length options
7 colors - four length options

Directions for both heel flap and gusset, as well as an afterthought heel are included in the pattern, but it is easy to substitute your favorite heel as well.

While the pattern is made for cuff-down knitting, it is easy to knit them toe up if that is more to your liking.  Just replace ""cuff"" with ""toe"" in the schedule and go from there!

This is an intermediate level pattern! The knitter should be very comfortable with knitting colorwork stitches and concepts as well as sock shaping techniques. 

You will need a fingering weight yarn! Superwash Merino/Nylon or other sock yarn that blocks nicely and is durable for wear.

The pattern is written for 3 colors with 1 contrasting color. However, you can use more colors! I provide yardage for each single colorblock in each size, so you can use up more scraps/mini skeins if you would like instead of sticking to the 4 colors as written! Feel free to get creative!

***

Part of a collaboration with Marissa of Fantasy Fibers Yarn Co. for her Crescent City themed New Year’s Eve Box as we enter 2024, this sock pattern was designed to work with both high and low contrast yarns! The subtle textures will not be lost in highly variegated colorways, but they are interesting enough to elevate a tonal colorway to give it some depth!

The socks are knit starting at the cuff, and working downward toward the toes. The cuff ribbing finishes with a subtle eyelet detail to form peaks, and two columns of lacey eyelets are carried downward down the leg and the foot while the rest is worked in a simple texture. The lace pattern that runs down the leg and foot is charted, and the instructions are written to accommodate the magic loop method for small circumferences but they are easily adapted to using other methods if preferred.

[Here][2] is a link to the project page for the sample.

***

**Sizes**: finished foot circumference of 6.25, 7.5 (8.75, 10) inches, or 15.9, 19 (22.2, 25.5) cm

* This measurement is taken around the widest part of your foot

* Recommended ease: up to you! I like socks with a looser fit, so I chose a size larger than my foot circumference, but if you like a more snug fit then size down! Alternatively, you can adjust your needle size to fine tune the sizing a bit more – sock sizing is very versatile!

* The samples were knit in size 8.75”, and modeled on a foot measuring ~7.75” (giving ~1” / 2.5 cm of positive ease)

**Needles**:

* Size US 1 / 2.25 mm DPNs or long circular needles for magic loop

**Yarn**: fingering weight yarn in one or two colors:

* MC: 260, 280 (300, 320) yards, or 237, 256 (274, 292) meters

* CC: 55, 60 (65, 70) yards, or 50, 55 (60, 64) meters – for contrast heel and toe

* Sample used Fantasy Fiber Yarn Co. – Enemies to Lovers Fingering in sock set colorways Crown Prince of the Valbaran Fae and Starborn

**Gauge**: 32 sts x 40 rows = 4” x 4” stockinette stitch, worked flat on size US 1 / 2.25 mm needles and blocked lightly

The sock looks best in a light to medium solid or semi-solid yarn with a good twist.  The pattern will look good in a darker yarn, but the design will become more textural, since the flow of the stitches will not be easily seen.

534353,Fork in the Road Socks,Lara Neel,3.07,32.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,393.0,"I want to show off the design possibilities for self-striping yarn and my favorite afterthought heel. However, to keep the length of the foot easily customizable, the sock needs to be made out of order and from the top down. The ""afterthought"" heel is made after the leg and before the foot. So, an unusually-shaped sock, worked in the most common top-down order of things.

Along the front of the sock, the stripes should be all the
same depth, with just a little extra work from you when
joining new yarn for the foot. An extra-deep stripe forms under the heel. It looks like a fork in the road to me.

If you think you don’t like the fit of afterthought heels, I
hope you’ll try this wonderful version. It is automatically
customized to fit the wearer, and I have never known
anyone who tried it who didn’t fall in love. In my book,
Sock Architecture, I call it the thumb-joint hat top heel. To make it fit perfectly, you will have to measure the feet and part of the thumb of the wearer, which should confuse them greatly. It’s always fun to scare the muggles, isn’t it?",,262,399,4.35,"XS (Women’s M/Men's S, Men’s M/L)",Fingering

**Cleave** verb *split or sever, especially along a natural line or grain*

These socks start out like a standard top-down sock, but things take a little twist when you get to the heel. Instead of setting half the stitches aside and working a heel flap on the other half, you'll keep working in the round, increasing at the beginning and midpoint of the round to form the heel flap and gusset. Then you'll switch to working in rows to turn the heel and work a bit of the sole. Finally, you'll resume working in the round again to finish off the foot.

This construction is comfy and looks great, but it also eliminates the need to pick up stitches along the sides of the heel flap (a process that many knitters dislike). Also, if your socks tend to wear out under the heel (as mine so often do), you can easily carry a reinforcing thread along with your yarn when working the section in rows for added durability. If you've only ever made top-down socks with heel flaps in the past, this approach is a simple, nonthreatening way to branch out into another type of construction.

But don’t worry, if you’re feeling like different is hard (and really, we all have those days), there’s a variation included in the individual version to let you work them with a traditional heel flap. Because really, that cable is pretty enough to carry the show without any extra fancy bits!

<hr><hr><hr>

They're written in five sizes (56, 64, 72, 80, and 88 stitch cast ons) to fit most anyone. And of course you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the sock. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a sturdy sock fabric with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 7, 8, or 9 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for the size you need. With that range of sizes and gauges, the socks will fit a foot (measured around the ball of the foot) between 6.75 and 13.75 inches (with lots of points in between).

<hr><hr><hr>

**These are perfect for you if:**
* You want to play with a fun way to put socks together...but without letting things get too wild
* You share my fondness for that beautiful cable
 
**They’re** ***not*** **for you if:***
* You don't like charts (the pattern uses charts)
* You hate swatching (you need to swatch to check your needle size)

<hr><hr><hr>

Just as a heads up, a version of the pattern was originally included in the book *New Directions in Sock Knitting* and had since been published in a few other collections.  Those version do not include the traditional heel variant or the alternate gauge information, but if you have any of those books, you do already have most of what's in the individual version.

**Designed for my late daughter, Kaylan, that died by suicide in March '20. She loved rainbows and this yarn/pattern would have made her smile** :)

Looking for a little more than a vanilla sock for your striping sock yarn? Summer Stripes Sock Series patterns are perfect for you!

Slipped Up was designed to work perfectly with self-striping yarn. With a slipped stitch pattern across half of the stitches and stockinette on the other Slipped Up fits so many feet and yarns!

These socks are inspired by the musical *Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812*

The project include two sizes. The smaller size uses a 'scaled down' version of the pictured sock's chart. 

Adult- 80 sts (Adult small- 72 sts)

This pattern was originally knitted and designed with DPN but can be adapted to your preferred needle type. 

Stranded colorwork usually has less stretch that one-color stockinette, so plan for little to no negative ease. 

The length of the foot can be adjusted by knitting additional eye of partridge rounds in the toe section. ",,21,151,4.33,Adult and Adult small,Fingering

Sometimes a pattern comes to my mind fully formed. That was the case with the easy colorwork for Megaliths – and knitters have responded, making multiple Megaliths Hats in multiple color combos, each better than the last. So let’s try it on socks, shall we? Knit from the top down in 6 sizes, the Megaliths Socks are the perfect chance to play with color – and use up some leftover scraps, too!

This sock is a great first colorwork pattern. It's knit from the cuff down with a cuff, heel, and toe in a contrast color. Much of the sock is in glorious (and quick!) stockinette.

**What test knitters had to say:**

* ""It's a good beginning colorwork since there's no floats to trap!""
* ""I like that it was simple and that the pattern was easy to memorize. Good TV knitting.""
* ""I liked it a lot, the color work section was a lot of fun and it was nice to have some stockinette.""
* ""I like the way you broke down each section. This could be someone's first sock pattern and simultaneously their first colorwork sock pattern.""

I have always had a thing for slouchy cozy socks, I hope you will want to knit tons of these for yourself and gifts. These socks feel like you are wearing a warm hug. The leg of the sock can be lengthened or shortened, you can just add more or less repeats to make the socks of your dreams. The mohair or optionally suri sections are knit using the same needle size don’t worry if these sections are looser it just adds to the scrunched effect, conversely if you are a tighter knitter you can size up your needle just for the leg or add more pattern repeats. The pattern is knit top down, I used magic loop, it has a heel flap and gusset, but do use a heel style that you most like. You can knit this pattern in multiple colors and add stripes or use the same color palette and have some cozy monochrome socks. The possibilities are endless. 

**Sizes**
Adult **S**(7” 18cm circumference ), **M**(8” 20.5cm circumference ), **L**(9” 23cm circumference ) Choose a size that is 1”/2.5 cm less than your foot circumference.

This intricate-looking, lace sock pattern reminds me of tulips (hence the name). Worked from the top-down, the pattern is easier to knit than it appears and really shows off best in more subtle yarns like solid, semi-solid or slow gradient colorways. The pattern includes written and charted instructions for two sizes.

**Additional Yarn Information:**  1 skein each #730 Natural and #880 Charcoal.

**From Pattern Introduction:** It seems earthy, practical socks are always designed with men in mind - as if women never herded sheep or worked in the fields or went on a hike! These socks, adapted from a pair from the Shetland Island of Foula, are women's socks. They will make good boot or Birkenstock socks. Their design ... reflects the use of natural colored wool in the welt ribbing, the heel, and the toe. The heel is reinforced with slipped stitches and is shaped with a Round Heel. A Star Toe completes the foot.

They add interest to plain or multi-colored yarn. The heel is a very interesting combination short-row and flapped heel, similar to the one on Coupling from Knitty.

I wanted something that would lend interest but wouldn’t detract form the striping effect. This simple lace design is also great for beginners ready to try their first patterned socks.

**NOTE** I've had several knitters tell me that the US 2 (2.75mm) needles were too large and they sized down to US 1 (2.25mm) needles. My gauge has changed a lot over the last couple years and I've found myself sizing down as well. So please check your gauge before starting to knit!

104642,Temperance,L Abinante,3.28,32.0,4.0,lattice motif,400.0,"I really like watching Bones. I think it’s a great show, and I love the cast. Temperance “Bones” Brennan is hilarious, and I love her personal sense of style. The weird chunky necklaces, the bold understated colors… the people who pick out her clothes are doing a great job if you ask me.

So I thought to myself, “what kind of knit socks would Bones wear?” It had to be something simple, elegant, and understated. Something that a man or a woman could wear, something that could be dressed up or dressed down. Which, quite frankly, was a tall order. But I think I succeeded in my quest to design the perfect socks for Temperance.

A lattice pattern composed of right and left twists, this sophisticated sock pattern may suit both men and women. With a pattern repeat of only 10 stitches, this sock is easily sized up or down.

Although instructions are provided for a toe-up sock, the lattice pattern is reversible and can easily be switched to create a cuff-down version. 

There are two PDF downloads available. The first is the pattern in its entirety, and the second contains modifications for those wishing to knit the medium size. I have kept them separate because the instructions for the medium size would have muddled up the pattern and made it difficult to read – at least, in my opinion.

The pattern includes 2 sizes, with unstretched circumferences of 7.20″, 9.20″ (S, L). [Additional modifications to knit a Medium size (8.20"") are available as well][1].

Instructions are charted and written out.

You have to learn a lot of new skills in order to do them, and that can be hard to do on your own. Once you learn how to do them, though, you’ll never look back.

You can make your socks two-at-a-time, and try them on as you go! Since I love to teach toe-up socks, I created a **video e-book course** that guides you through all the steps of learning this new technique.

**What you’ll learn in the video e-book:**
--Judy’s Magic Cast-On
--Invisible increases
--“Reading” your work so you can go faster
--The amazing (and easy) no-holes Fleegle Heel
--How to knit backwards
--Invisible Ribbed Bind-Off
--Two-at-a-Time method
--How to knit any size of toe-up sock in any weight
--Tips and tricks for mastering toe-up socks (including preventing your balls of yarn from getting tangled) and MUCH more

This book **comes with a pattern** for worsted-weight toe-up socks so that the project goes super-quick, and you get comfortable with making socks before you move on to using small needles. You'll need a US size 7 47-inch-long circular needle.

**What is a video e-book?**
--It’s a written book with videos integrated into the lessons
--The videos stream from the Internet
--You can download the book instantly
--The streaming videos save your computer’s hard-drive space
--You get a front-row view of everything you need to learn
--The full-page videos play right in your book

My in-person Two-at-a-Time Toe-Up Sock class is **$35** for a two-week class. The flight to Salt Lake City is about **$350!** But when you instantly download the video e-book, you get the entire course on your computer, to watch and learn at your own pace.

You get a **way better view** than you do in my classes, plus you can pause it anytime! With **10-25** videos per course, this is a great resource. I’ve decided to introduce my “Toe-Up, One-or-Two-at-a-Time Socks” course at LESS THAN HALF the price of my class - $14.97.

Since I want you to **LOVE knitting toe-up socks**, try my e-ebook and if you don’t love it and tell all your friends, I’ll give you your **money back** and help you find a way to get the resources that work for you.

So, like little kids stuck inside on rainy days, the winter months make me grumpy and impatient, waiting for the sunny weather to return to California. When this lovely yellow yarn arrived in my mailbox, I knew it wanted to become something lacy, intricate and spring-inspired. Being a scientist by trade and naturalist at heart, the inspiration for my designs invariably comes from the natural world. The Eternal Spring socks developed from my love of leafy, flowery motifs and, of course, lace knitting.

These top-down socks feature a delicate lacy/textured pattern inspired by spring flora, just what we all want after the seemingly long winter months.

Maybe you’re knitting for a guy who wants you to keep it simple. Or you have some gorgeous yarn in a simple colorway that you would like to highlight? Well, then…This pattern is for you! 
I designed this pattern as a quick and easy knit for beginners or experienced knitters who want a break. The overall pattern is a simple knit and purl combo which I have written out and charted so you have your choice on which to follow. What could be easier than just K and P?! 

The pattern is subtle at first, but hang in there--after a few rows, it shows up as small diamonds traveling diagonally—very satisfying! I was going to name this pattern “spiffy diamonds” but my test knitter kept remarking how the pattern and the colors I had chosen made the socks look like a mermaid’s tail (it didn’t hurt that I happened to be wearing fish scale leggings in the exact same color at the time!). So when the Universe (in the form of my intrepid test knitter) is trying to tell me something, I just have to listen, eh? Mermaid’s Tail it is! Of course, you may knit them up in whatever color you like. And don’t let the name fool you: these are well suited for a pair of men’s socks, too. I am showing contrasting cuffs, heels and toes in my version, but feel free to go all one yarn if that floats your boat. Or just use contrasting for the heel and toes; there are several possibilities.

This pattern is appropriate for sock beginners that have made a least one pair of vanilla socks and thus know knitting basics. However, I have included a lot of how-to details in sock construction that the intermediate or advanced knitter can easily skim over, especially if they make choices for an alternate cuff ribbing or heel type.

Note: I knit socks on 4 DPNs at a time, I have attempted to generalize my instructions for folks who use other needle set ups. In the sock shown, I have used 80 g (~320 yds) of the main color and 20 g (~80 yds) of the contrasting color.

*“The world doesn’t just let girls decide what they want to be. But I can now...”*
*– Arya Stark,* Game of Thrones

Arya Stark is perhaps the most underestimated force in all of Westeros. Although she is a young girl, Arya is quickly established as an force to be reckoned with. These socks call to mind the crossed swords of her Needle, easily worked with left and right twists to create cables without the need for a cable needle. The cables are framed by stark banners of stockinette along a background of garter stitch. Worked in Lolodidit Everyday Sock, these toe-up socks create a statement that is every bit as strong and powerful as the youngest Stark daughter. May we all have the strength to Fight Like a Girl.

*“What do I care how ‘e looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave!”– Fleur Delacour, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*

Fleur Delacour is a force to be reckoned with in the wizarding world. Full of beauty, brains, and bravery, she is chosen to represent the entire Beauxbatons school in the Triwizard Tournament. Worked from the toe-up, these socks pair silky wisps of mohair with sock yarn to create an overlay of diamond patterning throughout, finished with a lacy cuff.  While they may appear delicate at first, you’ll soon find that, much like Fleur, these socks are both strong and beautiful.

I love this quote. If you are an Anne of Green Gables fan like I am, I hope you will love this cable sock pattern inspired by this quote from the books. 

Comfy cables for late autumn. This pattern has both cuff down and toe up instructions, chart and written chart instructions. Don't be scared by the cables, they are simple cables and intuitive. I recommend using a lifeline if you are not confident about cables or this is your first time knitting them.

* The socks are worked from top down. The cable pattern on leg extends across top of instep.
* If you would like to knit those socks without beads, just simply replace PBK stitch with “knit” (k) stitch and continue with the pattern instructions. You may also want to skip beads on the foot if your are planing to wear them with shoes.
* Those beads look so pretty, but please note that you can feel the coolness of the beads next to your skin. As for myself, I like it, but this is the matter of a personal preferences.

> I love knitting thick marled socks. Worked with two strands of fingering weight sock yarn held double, they are warm & cozy, quick to knit, beautiful, and unique.  For the samples shown here, a variegated colorway is paired with a coordinating tonal, but there are many other options. Self-striping yarns look great when paired with a relatively neutral solid or semi-solid color. Using two highly contrasting yarns emphasizes the marl effect. You can even use a mini-skein set or random leftovers as one of the strands held with a single color that ties them all together. A simple sock project with endless color possibilities - yes please!

Put a twist on the classic vanilla sock by marling two light fingering yarns. Mix and match sock components along the way to get your perfect pair. Construction involves working cuff-down, a German short row heel, and a basic wedge toe.

This pattern also includes a vector art diagram for yarn placement. If you have a bunch of partial ball windings that you would like to use up, it makes the perfect stash buster!

**Notes:**

**Knitting Tension:** I knit these socks using a 000 / 1.5mm 24"" circular needle. If you are able to actively adjust gauge while knitting, it will help with the construction of the sock. For the main body of the sock I knit relatively loosely and then only for the toe section and very central shapes, I knit tightly (keeping each stitch close to the needle as I drew the yarn through). This modification may affect your speed while knitting, so that is a good hint with tension. If you find it quick and easy to knit, it may be loose. If it is a little slower and more of a struggle to move the yarn, the tension will probably be tighter. Likewise - around the opening of the sock, here you will want to intentionally knit a little looser or tighter depending on your preference for fit. The sock can be knit without these finer adjustments, but will fit a little more snugly done in this manner. Additionally, because I knit loosely on the 000, you could just as easily knit a little tighter overall and go up a needle size or two, especially if you prefer a looser sock.

**Fit:** I wear a size US9 shoe and love the feel of the Small sock on my foot. I prefer a sock to fit a little more snugly! If you have similar preferences, I would suggest knitting the smallest size first. You could also knit the appropriate size, but go down a needle size for a little tighter fit. 

**Yarn:** Urth Uneek fingering worked perfectly for this sock design. It has a beautiful gradual transition from one color to the next, frequently pooling into the patterned shapes. It also gives a very fun and irregular look from the right side of the sock to the left side, as well as from one sock to the next making it great for individuals who love mix-n-match socks! You could also use any sock yarn or gradient combination. ",9.0,16,85,5.0,"Adult: Small, Medium, Large",Fingering

Marie works as a radiologic technologist at Kleinman Radiology Center, a medical scanning and X-ray office. She is also a kleptomaniac (this will come up later in the design). 

The socks are designed after Marie’s knit top she wears in the show. They are knit cuff down, with chevron arrows stacked and slip columns running down on either side, an Eye of the Partridge Heel Flap, and a star toe (because she thinks she’s the star of the family). 

There are four (4) sizes available with this pattern – Extra Small (56 Stitches), Small (60 Stitches), Medium (64 Stitches), and Large (72 Stitches). If you need a different size, just make sure you have at least 22 stitches for the design on the leg and foot.

1331907,Singularity,Jeny Staiman,3.8,32.0,4.0,Stockinette,450.0,"I'm an avid sock knitter and designer and I am in love with gradient yarn. I find the gradual color change mesmerizing. But using gradient yarn to knit socks is tricky. Socks are not worked continuously – the rounds are interrupted by the heel turn, which is worked back and forth. By the time you finish the heel and return to working in the round, your slow-moving gradient has probably taken a noticeable leap, yielding a break in hue right across the instep.

Singularity is engineered to yield a perfect unbroken gradient along the length of the entire sock. The unique heel structure is worked in the round along with the sock body, allowing a single working strand to flow continuously from toe to cuff. It celebrates gradual color change in all its beauty and glory. No matter where you transition from foot to heel to leg, the resulting sock perfectly reflects the color’s journey.

Photos feature Freia Sole Mates in Canyon, Sweet Georgia double sock blank in Lighthouse, Fiber Optics in Damson to Gold, Fairy Godmother Dyeworks in Rooster, and an early iteration made with Urth self striping. 

Because of the unusual construction, the sock feels quite snug while pulling it over the ankle. Once on, it fits beautifully and snugly.

Fuzzypeg socks use  a combination of fingering-weight sock yarn together with a lace-weight mohair blend to give them a light, airy feel, while maximizing warmth and coziness. They are a quick knit at a relaxed gauge, which helps the mohair to fluff up and fill in the spaces between stitches.
There are some special features in this pattern that will be appreciated by all sock knitters— the cable and rib pattern is continued across the instep, making the sock quite elastic, stretching to fit a range of widths. The length of both the top and the foot can be adjusted to suit your preference. The toe is shaped as for a traditional wedge toe, but finishes off with a the final few sts drawn together as is done for the finishing of a cap (no kitchener stitch needed!).

**Sample:** Mountain Colors Crazyfoot in Harmony Mist - 3ply 90% Wool 100g

**Materials:**
• US 1 (2.25) circular knitting needles (or size needed to get gauge), I recommend at least 32 inches (my preferred length). You can substitute DPNs and 9-inch circulars for circulars as well and I'll show you how.
• 100 grams of fingering-weight sock yarn.
• Stitch marker or locking stitch marker (optional)
• Ruler or measuring tape.
• Darning needle.
• Sock blockers to photograph your socks once you're done! (optional).


**Notes:**
This pattern is written for magic loop, but can easily be changed to DPNs. Use 2 needles for N1, and another 2 for N2. If you're using 9-inch circulars, there will be notes throughout to guide you. The pattern is written for cuff-down and toe-up, for most lace patterns, it's not a perfect reversal and this pattern is an example of that. The lace is very close, but it's not perfect and there is a slight difference between toe-up and cuff-down on the lace panel. tI gives the very same effect, the difference is the placement of the lace from one side of the swirl to the other. It's very slight.

Any yarn, any gauge, plug in your measurements

**New Pathways for Sock Knitters,** which I published in 2007, is by far my most ambitious and comprehensive sock book. It contains 8 unique architectures, each one introduced with a quick little baby or toddler sock, followed by a collection of adult designs, and a Master pattern so that you can literally knit an infinite number of variations on each architecture. 

**Hundreds of designers have used these architectures as a leaping-off point for their own innovations,** with the Riverbed, Upstream, and Cedar architectures appearing most often. This was my hope—that the new fields I plowed would become gardens in the minds and hands of others, including you! 

**This digital version of the book insures that it can remain a resource for knitters and designers forever.**

**Coriolis architecture** is a toe-up method with increases distributed within a band that spirals from mid-foot either to the ankle (upper images), or all the way up and around the leg (lower images). This Master Pattern lets you design your own, using any yarn for any foot in the universe!

The array of new sock constructions available today is marvelous. It's wonderful that knitters are turning their creativity loose on something as classic and functional as the humble sock. But every now and then, it's fun to return to the basic form. 

This construction of this sock is quite simple.  It is knit top down with a heel flap, traditional gussets, and basic toe. But this simple form allows the intricate patterning to shine. The front and back of the sock feature an elaborate criss cross pattern (it's easier than it looks, and all done without a cable needle). The front and back are separated by a charming bit of fancy ribbing which carries on down the side of the foot and the heel. The combination is lovely and reminds me of intricate tile work.

All Aes Sedai helped where and when they could, but the Green Ajah alone was always with the armies, in almost every battle. We were the counter to the Dreadlords. The Battle Ajah. And now we stand ready, for the Trollocs to come south again, for Tarmon Gai’don, the Last Battle. We will be there. That is what it means to be a Green.”

This is a 2-color stranded colorwork sock utilizing a diamond lattice pattern.  The diamonds shift between the main color and contrast color and then back again before the toe.  The pattern is mimicked on the sole, and pinstriped gussets merge into a simple stripe that runs down the sides of the foot.

The cuff, heel flap and toe are knit using size 1 (2.25mm) needles while the colorwork portion calls for size 1.5 (2.5mm).  Knit with a 5"" leg and 9"" foot, the designer used approximately 70g MC and 50g CC.

Picture yourself on a train in a station... knitting these socks.  I just hope they don't give you kaleidoscope eyes.

512038,"Dyad Socks, Top Down",Lara Neel,2.75,32.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,525.0,"I chose “dyad” as the name for these socks as a kind of reference to my thought process.
I wanted to explore the easiest way I know to make a two-color sock: one color for the heel and toe, and another for the rest of the sock. I was also eager to use a band heel and a toe to match.
So (in my mind), bands with two colors = two things to do with musical bands = two notes = two notes played together = (a short trip to Google) = dyad. Dyad also means, in many other contexts, sets of two. What could be more perfect for a pair of socks?
I hope you find harmony with these easy socks. The band heel is an interesting exercise in shaping. The gusset shaping happens almost entirely within the heel, leaving the foot of the sock mostly undisturbed. A straight heel flap gives way to a short area of shaping with decreases. The lines created by the decreases are then continued with back-and-forth shaping, which is what actually turns the heel.
A sideways toe matches this heel quite nicely. It fits like a wedge toe and can be made short, medium or long, to fit wide, medium, or pointy toes.",,88,29,4.62,"Women’s XS (Women’s S, Women’s M/Men’s S, Women’s L/Men’s M, Men’s L, Adjustable Size)",Fingering

I use this as my beginner sock pattern to teach with.

I recommend Opal Sock yarn or other self striping yarn as I find it encourages new knitters and they feel the socks are more exciting.

*Gördes (sometimes Ghiordes) is a town in western Turkey, where rugs have been made since at least the eighteenth century. In the late nineteenth century, the prayer rug style became popular, and any rug with an arch was likely to be called a Gördes. Books from this period are often full of blatantly incorrect (though charmingly romantic) information about both the town and the rugs.*

*Rugs of strikingly different colors, materials, and constructions have been attributed to Gördes, and telling a real Gördes from a fake can be challenging. Many feature an arch supported by decorated columns, both elements represented in these socks.*

*Nain is a small town in the middle of Iran on the rim of the Great Desert. Woolen textiles have been produced in Nain for centuries though rugs have only been produced since the 1930s. The rugs produced in Nain are among the most finely knotted carpets currently made. They are some of the best known and most expensive of the modern rugs.*

*Nain rugs usually feature intricate floral designs, elaborate medallions, and a very characteristic color palette. These socks incorporate the curvilinear lines and pale blue color traditional of this style.*

For Socktober 2020, I thought it would be fun to design a pair of socks with the help of the community that has so kindly supported my designs these last few years. To do that, I sifted through all my favorite design elements, drafted a few possible stitch patterns, and posted them, bit by bit, in my Instagram stories for voting. Everybody had 24 hours to weigh in on their favorite option, and at the end of that period, I incorporated the winner into the pattern I was writing.

These socks are the result of that community design project. They feature a 1x1 twisted rib cuff, an all-over stitch pattern with a spiral of eyelets, a heel flap and gusset, and a round toe. It’s been such a treat working on these socks with everybody, and I look forward to doing it again next year.

I try my very best to make sure that all of my patterns are error-free and easy to follow. If you have any trouble with this pattern, please let me know! You can reach me by email at abeeinthebonnet@gmail.com, on Ravelry at abeeinthebonnet, on Instagram at @lizzird, and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/abeeinthebonnet. 

And of course, if you share photos of your project on social media, I’d love to see them! Please tag your photos with #ABITBSocktober and #ABITBKnits to share with others.

This cuff-down sock has been designed in a textured rib pattern. The easy-to-memorize rounds will result in a visually appealing and comfortable sock.

I designed this sock with my husband in mind. Jeff is a truly knit-worthy man who appreciates my hand made socks. He is also particularly fond of ribbed patterns since they fit so well. I have knit him many K3P1 socks, and wanted to come up with a ribbed sock with a little more interest. Thus, these were born.

Arethusa Falls is the second largest waterfall in the state of New Hampshire. We’ve enjoyed a few hikes there over the years. The columns of the sock remind me of the falls.

This pattern includes adult sizes in small, medium, and large for foot circumferences of 8"", 9"", and 10"" and allowing for about 1"" of negative ease for a good fit. It has a ribbed cuff, a slip stitch heel flap and gusset, and a rounded toe. It is written for contrasting heels, toes, and cuffs, but can easily be knit in one color as well. Both the leg length and the foot length can be easily adjusted. You will need approximately 100g of sock yarn for this project, along with 20 or more grams of a contrasting color.

The textured pattern is produced with knit and purl stitches and is easy to memorize. Instructions for the pattern are both written out and charted. It is not written for a specific sock knitting method, but it would be best if the knitter is familiar with sock knitting since not every technique is described in detail. The knitter should be familiar with their preferred needle method (i.e. magic loop, DPNs, 9"" circulars, etc.) and should know basic stitches (k2tog, ssk, kitchener). A glossary is included in the pattern.

*** I tried to keep my pattern as simple as possible so that if you choose to print it out, you won't be using a whole lot of ink and paper. I have a nice big photo on the first page and a number of photos on the last, so you can see the beautiful socks you can make, but you don't have to print them if ink is a concern for you. That stuff is pricey! The rest of the pages are simple, mostly text, with a just a few small pictures.

You may sell finished socks that you have knit with this pattern as long as you credit me as the pattern designer.

OK, I’ll admit it; I’ve always adored colorwork socks. I cut my (knitting) teeth on traditional Fair Isle and Nordic type designs and I still knit and design with motifs that fall into those categories. But lately I’ve been branching out to motifs that repeat, but are NOT horizontal. They repeat, but step up each time and then interlock together for a quite different overall appearance. They can end up looking kind of random or chaotic or appear as a high or low spiral of some sort. What fun!

> (lean) as the shapes repeat, they can
> be flipped to generate a mirror image
> that leans in the other direction
> quite easily. These mirror images can
> be subtly different or quite striking
> depending on the motif itself.

…So I went a little overboard with this pair of socks. Not one, but two of my original non-horizontal designs are presented. Then I flipped each of them. The left leaning versions are segregated onto one sock and the right leaning versions are on the other sock for some subtle mirroring action…so that’s up to 4 patterns now. I wanted to keep the patterns distinct so each transition is marked with a horizontal border stripe pattern. 5 patterns. Whew!

I think the resulting socks have an air of a tribal or ethnic pattern from long ago. Those gradual spirals really triggered something in my memory from grade school, so after a bit of cogitating I managed to dredge up the memory and I named these socks for the stepped tower/temple from ancient Mesopotamia, the Ziggurat.

**These socks are knit top down using two solid colors of fingering yarns. Please be sure to use strongly contrasting Dark and Light colors. Choosing yarns that are variegated or not strongly contrasting will obscure the pattern. The heel is mostly worked integrally and thus cannot be worked in a separate color. As always: when working a colorwork pattern that contains floats (and there are a few here and there in these socks), care must be taken to expand stitches as you knit so that the resulting sock is not too snug to pull on over the heel.** 

*I knit socks on 4 DPNs at a time, I have attempted to generalize my instructions for folks who use other needle set-ups.*

***Please also visit my [blog][1] and my [YouTube channel][2] for ongoing updates and video demos.***

Tachyon is a clocks sock worked from the toe up. Given that clocks socks are typically worked top down, I think of this sock as stitches traveling back through time. The clock hands wiggle around as they make their way up the foot, each one meeting its counterpart at the ankle and then continuing up the leg together.

This pattern debuts three sock-specific techniques I have recently developed. Each of the following links takes you to a free tutorial on my blog.

* A method for picking up and working edge stitches that leaves a smooth seam (“[My Edge][3]”); *note this technique is a critical component in both of the next two:* 
* A banded toe (“[Banditoe][4]”), and 
* A toe-up flap & turn heel (“[Jeny’s Square Peg Heel][5]”).

If you, like me, can’t resist putting your own personal touch on the things you knit, Tachyon is well suited to a choose-your-own-adventure approach. You are the boss of your knitting!

**This pattern is written for visual learners.** I developed this pattern format especially for highly visual, quirky brains like mine.  Because it's my party! 

1. *The charts look like the real thing.* I used [Stitch Maps][6] for the charts; Stitch Maps generates charts that are not based on a grid, but rather give you a true sense of what your fabric will look like. 
2. *The written instructions are easy to parse.* Instructions are given in a tabular rather than paragraph format, so you can more easily spot how the stitches in each round translate to the charts, and to the end result.
3. *Each size has its own file.* When I'm knitting a thing, I only need the instructions for my size. Having all the numbers, charts and instructions for all sizes all together creates so much cognitive noise for me that I can't visualize what I'm making. So in this pattern, each size has a standalone file. (If you purchase any one size, it's free to acquire the files for all the other sizes.)

**FAQ**
***How do I determine my size?***
***Is negative ease incorporated into the pattern?*** 
To determine your size, measure your foot circumference  at the narrowest point (just past the ball of the foot, at the start of the arch). Decide how much negative ease you want in the width of your sock (for me, 1"" is the right amount) and take note of the unstretched circumferences for each size (6, 7, 8, 9""). Pick the size that most closely accommodates your desired amount of negative ease. For reference, my foot has a 9"" circumference and size M (8"" unstretched) is the right size for me.

For negative ease along the *length* of the foot, the pattern instructions already incorporate negative ease. The simplest way IMO to determine, without measuring, where to transition from the foot to the heel is to work to the point where you would normally start increasing for the gusset. For me, that's where the unstretched sock reaches the middle of my arch, and stretches comfortably to the front edge of my heel pad. That's about 1 inch of negative ease.

But if you are a numbers geek, here are the specifics. The first number range is the distance from where you stop working the (sock) foot, to the back of the (body) heel:
Size XS: 2-2.5"" = 0.4-0.8"" neg ease
Size S: 2.25-2.75"" = 0.5-0.9"" neg ease
Size M: 2.5-3"" = 0.5-1"" neg ease
Size L: 2.75-3.25"" = 0.6-1.1"" neg ease

***What's JMCO?***
**JMCO** = Judy's Magic Cast On. It's an invisible cast on that is great for socks. Judy has a video [here][7], and I have an illustrated tutorial on my blog [here][8]. (Note I do JMCO a little differently than Judy... I like to start on the bottom needle.)

For any other abbreviations you don't recognize, feel free to ask me or Google. :) 

***Errata:***
There were several errors on size Large. V5 corrects these errors. (Sizes XS, S and M are all v4.)
1. Text twice incorrectly referred to Round 23 for each foot, where it should have said Round 24. 
2. The stitch counts for the right foot, 2nd column from right, were are undercounted by 1. (total stitch counts were correct tho)

All sizes, in the heel section under ""Work the Heel Turn,"" Row 4 (WS) reads ""Sl 1 p1 wyif"" -- that **p1** is supposed to be a **pw**.

I do realize that turning a heel and knitting a gusset aren’t the worst things in the world, (in fact, some knitters really enjoy that step,) but I’ve always dreaded it and it was the one thing that prevented me from knitting all the socks. 

CHOOSING YOUR SOCK SIZE:	
It’s very important to have negative ease and a snug fitting sock when knitting The Magic Heel Socks. One tip is to knit the main body of your sock in the needle size stated in the pattern and then knit the heel section in a needle that is one size smaller.
*If you want to get really accurate, measure your foot circumference around the ball of your foot (the padded area just under your toes) and measure the area around your heel and ankle (round to the nearest ¼”/.5 cm). Use the larger of these 2 numbers and multiply by .95 – this should be the finished circumference of your socks.

What exactly are the BENEFITS of knitting Magic Heel Socks? 
I’m so glad you asked!
1. No finicky heel means these socks are a complete joy to knit, especially for beginner or nervous sock knitters!
2. Knit cuff-down, (but easily adjustable to be knit toe-up). 
3. They’re ideal if you’re using self-striping yarn because your stripes will be uninterrupted. 
4. They’re perfect for fast-growing children’s feet because they’re quick to knit and the heel can accommodate multiple sizes. 
5. They make the best gift knits, especially when you’re not exactly sure what size feet your recipient has. The perfect way to keep them a surprise!
6. When your socks finally wear out, you can easily mend them by cutting your sock, (just above or below the worn area) picking up the live stitches and then re-knitting your sock down or up. You’ll get twice as much wear out of your Magic Heel socks this way.

This sock is based off of the 5 characters from The Breakfast Club. You have a brain, an athlete, a basketcase, princess and a criminal; all joined together through their experience at Shermer High School Saturday detention.

You can choose to only do the striping on the leg of the sock (pgs 5-6), which will generally use less than 10g of each CC (depending on size and length), or stripe the entire sock (pgs 3-4), which will use 20g or less of each CC (depending on size and length). You could also use more than 5 colors or only use 2 colors for the stripes, but yarn usage will differ from amounts given. Great project for mini skeins/advent knitting or a scrappy project.

This sock is knit top down with a shadow wrap heel and a wedge toe. You can substitute another heel and toe if you would like, but the MC yarn amounts may change. It is written for magic loop, with N1 being the front of the leg/foot/toe and N2 being the back of the leg/heel/foot/toe.

1365597,Yarn Yogi,Stacey Lewis,0.0,32.0,4.0,stockinette,388.0,"> I designed these socks in collaboration with The Traveling Yarn Yogi and [they have kits available here!][1]

Introducing the **Yarn Yogi** socks - a perfect pattern for adventurous beginners ready to dive into more complex lace knitting. Starting with the Turkish cast-on method, you'll enjoy knitting these socks featuring a leaf pattern accompanied by spiral ribs on each side of the instep, extending up the front of the leg.

Yarn Yogi socks feature a 24-round pattern that I’ve made as intuitive as possible without compromising the overall look.  I’ve chosen the simplest and most appealing left and right twist stitches for the spiral rib, ensuring a relaxing knitting experience. With clear step-by-step instructions for the lace pattern and shadow wrap short row heel in each size, you'll be able to create these socks with ease. The spiral rib and lace pattern is also charted, for knitters who prefer to work off charts.

These socks are not only enjoyable to knit but also make a practical and stylish addition to your wardrobe. Crafted with Emma's Yarn Super Silky, the silk content provides both strength and a touch of luxury. The intricate lace and spiral rib pattern adds a touch of sophistication to any outfit.

**Techniques Used:**
Turkish cast on
Small circumference knitting in the round with magic loop
Short row heel with shadow wraps
KFB, and lifted increases
Right and left twist cable stitches
K2tog decreases
Jeny’s Surprisingly Stretchy Bindoff

♡ It features an easy-to-memorize, but elegant  twisted stitch pattern I had used in my earlier pattern [Manzil Mitts][3] too. These socks will make a great companion for the mitts. You can use the same coupon code on both patterns, if you like.:) 

♡It features directional toes where the left and right toes are shaped differently. This means that the left sock is to be worn on left foot and right sock on the right, similar to wearing shoes. It results in a well-fitting toe shape that contours the shape of the feet. I loved the fit when I discovered this toe and my testers loved it too! Please take a close look at our pictures here. I hope you'll give it a try. ♥️

**Ensnared** verb *taken or caught as if in a trap*

<hr><hr><hr>

You know how ribbed socks really are the best socks (shhh, it's a secret, don't tell lacy socks I said that)?  How they fit perfectly and are so comfy to wear and are super soothing to knit?  But you sort of want something a little zingier to really hold your attention?  Well these might just be the perfect pair!

The lattice work at the top is lovely and fun (and just fancy enough that you feel clever doing it), and the ribbing is comfy and shows off all your beautiful yarn perfectly.  The combo makes for a sock that is fun to knit and easy to wear (even if your intended sock target insists on fairly sedate socks).  

<hr><hr><hr>

They're written in four sizes (56, 64, 72, and 80 stitch cast ons) and you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the sock. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a sturdy sock fabric with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 7, 8, or 9 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for the size you need. With that range of sizes and gauges, the socks will fit a foot (measured around the ball of the foot) between 6.75 and 12.5 inches (with *lots* of points in between).

<hr><hr><hr>

**These are perfect for you if:**

* You share my secret belief that ribbed socks are the best
* You love that little bit of lattice
* You have some beautiful sock yarn to show off
 
**They’re** ***not*** **for you if:**

* You don't like charts (the pattern uses charts)
* You hate swatching (you need to swatch to check your needle size)

Hand-dyed, painted and variegated sock yarns are often so colorfully busy that any knitting stitch patterning simply disappears. These special yarns require a more simplistic approach such as the easy knit and purl combination used in these socks. The bonus is that this patterning makes a stretchy sock that wants to hug your leg and foot. Heel construction is the traditional flap & gusset method.

quite easy and enjoyable to knit.""

> The lace pattern in these socks was inspired by a
collection of narrow embroidered flower ribbons. I always start by charting several motifs, and it was a happy surprise to see how the decreases curved the little lace flowers into ribbons of roses that could alternate with purl columns along the length of the socks. The simple rose rib pattern repeats over 7  stitches and 8 rounds, so it is easy to memorize. Once I decide on the lace pattern, I have fun planning a top border for the cuff that will flow seamlessly into the lace. However, the border in this project is optional if you would prefer to have uninterrupted lace panels running all the way to the top of the sock.",,207,60,4.35,,Fingering

In the summer of 2022, I realized that maintaining a back catalog of hundreds of patterns was kind of overwhelming. I couldn’t do it and still release new things. So I took my old patterns down so I could keep doing new work. 

Since then, a handful of my favorites have [come back][11], and lovely new things have [come out][12]. But *the vast majority of the old patterns are retired and will no longer be generally available*.

***However, enough folks have asked about some old favorites that I’m planning to make many of the retired patterns available for a few days once or twice a year (most likely in late spring and then again in the fall around Thanksgiving).***

Curiosity cabinets were collections of wonderful objects brought together to inspire, delight, and inform.

Presented here, in this first volume of the series, is a knitter’s interpretation of a curiosity cabinet. It is an assemblage of lace and cables and ribbings (instead of the more traditional rocks and shells and leaves) that have been brought together to create 20 new patterns. In this book you’ll find ten socks, two hats, three cuffs, three cowls, and two shawls. 

There’s sure to be something worthy of being added to your own collection of knitted treasures.

Although the stitch repeat begins with a purl stitch, the pattern draws in like ribbing, and so laddering is not an issue. If you dislike beginning needles with purl stitches, consider using a 9"" circular needle for this pattern. Because of the stretchiness, one size should fit most!

672458,Prettified Thrash,Rich Ensor,4.55,30.0,4.0,pattern,,"I just wanted to make some simple socks. Sometimes life is chaotic and messy, so it’s nice to have a relaxing, not too complicated something on the needles. The idea was simple: a six stitch, six row repeat.

Did I mention that sometimes life gets chaotic? When chaos reigns, a person might shift the beginning of the round by 3 stitches after working two repeats and not realize it until 12 rounds later.

Rather than rip back and resume the simplicity, I declared this a design feature, and these socks were born. Granted, this turns a 6-row chart into an 18-row chart on the leg with a shift on row 12. That leads to some instep charts that are even longer that include 3 stitches that may or may not be worked depending on which size and which row you’re working. I promise, it looks much more complicated than it actually is.

With that said, you may be wondering what does any of this have to do with the not-at-all-common term “Prettified Thrash”. The same chaos that let to shifting the beginning of the round also made finding a creative and unique pattern name more challenging than it should be. So I resorted to the one thing that made sense: an anagram generator. “Shift Third Repeat” isn’t the most exciting name, but “Prettified Thrash” makes me laugh, and laughter is an excellent weapon against chaos.

Sleek and stylish, these cabled socks are cleverly constructed to transform your feet armed only with a set of knitting needles. Beginning with an anatomically correct toe, twisted cable stitches create the appearance of dragon scales that grow as you continue along the foot of the sock. Worked quickly without the need for a cable needle, the scales continue to expand as you cable around the leg. The left and right socks are worked as mirror images of one another, creating chic new transformative footwear to please your inner dragon.

With all humility, I present Lesula, a color work sock inspired by Monkey. With the combination of lace and purls, one of the things that jumps out to me about Monkey are these little triangles. That is where Lesula starts. Tiny little triangles worked in contrasting colors.

To avoid having a jog in the pattern, there is a colorwork seam worked into the back of the leg. The pattern for the seam finds itself appearing on the sole as well.

In trying to solve this dilemma, I paired a bunch of relatively color-coordinated scraps with a single contrast color (black). By carefully using the solid color, I was able to make the transitions between the different scraps of yarn look fairly cohesive, and not muddy.

This pattern contains my personal vanilla sock recipe. Feel free to substitute your own favorite, particularly if you prefer toe-up socks. Then use the charts and guidelines for transitioning between your various scraps.

One of my all time favorite Halloween movies is The Nightmare Before Christmas, and my favorite character is of course the level-headed Sally. I love her patchwork dress, and after taking an intarsia-in-the-round workshop at VKL, I wanted to sockify it!

This pattern is toe-up, uses a short row Sherman Heel, and incorporates the colorwork techniques intarsia-in-the-round (“Annetarsia”), stranding, and duplicate stitch. There are links to tutorials for the heel, Annetarsia, and duplicate stitching in the pattern. More pictures, including an Annetarsia tutorial, [here][1].

This is a great pattern for scraps, using up to 13 colors! That said, if you don’t have loads of bits and bobs to use, you’ll need a minimum of 4 different colors. See below for specific yardage requirements.

*“People say I’m the best boss. They go, ‘God, we’ve never worked in a place like this. You’re hilarious, and you get the best out of us.’ (*lifts up ‘World’s Best Boss’ coffee mug*) Um, I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.”
– Michael Scott, The Office*

Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin, is an iconic character that sometimes tries too hard (though rarely at his actual job). These socks might look complicated, but a few simple stitches will have them flying off your needles without trying hard at all. Left and right twists create cozy texture on the leg without the need for a cable needle, while the ribbed heel adds durability and comfort to the footwear. The texture changes on the instep of the sock will keep a comfortable fit when worn with work shoes. Once finished, you’ll walk away satisfied with a smile on your face. (That’s what she said...)

These charming socks feature easy-to-knit stranded colorwork on the upper leg, with another sweet “bracelet” of color just before the toe shaping. They’re worked top-down, but if you’re a fan of toe-up socks, you can easily adapt them - the colorwork patterns are identical in both directions. 

To make them, you’ll need about 300 yards/275 m of sock yarn for the main color and 75 yards/70 m for the contrast color.

The pattern’s named after the Mill River Conservation Area in Amherst, Massachusetts. The trails in the woods along the Mill River offer refreshing places to walk, sit and reflect, and knit or spin. It’s a calming, restorative place, lovely in all seasons, and I’m grateful it’s just a few minutes from home.

Inspired by a close-up view of a cactus plant, these socks are a wonderful combination of cozy ribbing and an eye-catching stitch pattern. Knit up in a slightly speckled yarn as shown in our sample or as a one-color version, they’ll look super good and keep your feet toasty warm!

The Cacti socks are constructed in the round from the cuff down (on a set of 4 dpns or with a circular needle for magic loop) and designed to both challenge beginner knitters and engage experienced knitters. The pattern features a decorative textured centre panel and an Eye of Partridge heel flap, as well as a heel design that combines traditional Dutch (square) heel and rounded heel techniques for a secure fit. The toe is shaped with decreases at the sides, and finished with Kitchener stitch.

This is the third pattern of four in my So Vanilla Socks collection. In this recipe, I’m going to teach you how to knit socks on 9-inch circulars, both cuff down and toe-up.

Whether you love them or hate them, everyone has an opinion on this newer sock knitting technique that’s gained a lot of popularity in the past few years. I originally didn’t enjoy them, but I made myself give them a real try about three years ago and actually found how much quicker I could finish a pair of socks without the fussing that comes with magic loop or my clumsiness with losing DPNs. I enjoyed the straightforwardness of it so much that 90% of my sock knitting changed over to 9-inch circulars.

**What You’ll Need:** 
2.25mm (US 1) 9-inch circular knitting needles (or size needed to get gauge) - Special Note: When using 9-inch circulars you’ll want to keep checking your gauge. Don’t assume that you’re going to get the same gauge with DPNs or Magic Loop with 9-inch circulars especially when you’ve knit for a few rounds and your knitting evens out as you get the hang of it. 
2.25mm (US 1) set of DPNs or 32 inch (or longer) circular needles for the heel and toes. Note: You can keep using the 9 inch circular for the heels, but I personally find it a lot easier to switch needles for this part. I use Addi Flexiflips for this since they’re easy to carry around and I get a similar gauge. 
100 grams of fingering weight sock yarn. 
3 ring type marker or locking stitch marker (optional). Note: It’s optional, but recommended. I use both with this method. 
Ruler or measuring tape
Darning needle.

**Gauge:**
8.5 stitches/inch using 2.25mm needles.



**Sizing:** 
1 (2, 3) - which fits around a foot circumference of 7 (8, 9) inches around.

I really, really like making efficient use of my yarn and want to use up every last bit of magic. After numerous pairs of socks, or perhaps a massive holiday miniskein project, you might ask yourself, “What’s up next?”

Try these socks! They’re perfect for even the tiniest leftovers (seriously, some of my strands were only a yard long). They give you an excuse to play with color. (Rainbow? Gradient? Monochrome? Totally random and wild? Matching socks? Fraternal?) Three strands of sock yarn held together add up to some seriously squishy socks – the equivalent of Aran weight. Let no scrap be left behind! 

**What test knitters had to say:**

* ""Quick knit. Loved it - easy to follow, used some of my stash and very cosy and comfy.""
* ""I love the effect when the individual strands of yarn are used from the different colours.""
* ""It was super fun! Great use of left over yarns.""
* ""Crystal clear pattern.""

**Sizes (sock circumference):**
*Choose a size 0-1”/0-2.5 cm smaller than actual foot circumference, as holding yarn tripled makes fabric less stretchy.*
* **1:** 5.25”/13.5 cm
* **2:** 6.25”/16 cm
* **3:** 7”/18 cm
* **4:** 7.75”/19.5 cm
* **5:** 8.5”/21.5 cm
* **6:** 9.25”/23.5 cm

Sample shown in size 4 on 8.5”/21.5 cm circumference foot in various fingering scraps, 3 strands held together.

**Blocked Gauge:**

Colorwork socks inspired by the cover of the novel of the same name. This haunting novel about star-crossed lovers inspired by Chinese mythology as well as Romeo and Juliet inspired the arrows, moon phases, and stars of this sock pattern.

This pattern celebrates the mystery of all that is in between... the liminal space of being Asian American diaspora, or whatever cultural in between space you may be in, the and the liminal spaces of being between the start and end of each moon cycle. There is abundant joy to be had in those in between spaces... as we await what is next and grow more into ourselves.

**PATTERN NOTES**
Yarn estimates are based on a sock foot length of 8½ (9½, 10½, 11½)”. You may need more or less yarn depending on foot length. For the best fit, knit socks ½” shorter than actual foot length.

These socks are knit seamlessly in the round from the cuff down and feature an afterthought heel.

When working the stranded colorwork method, two colors are carried across each row. For most knitters, there is a difference in how colors show up in the pattern that is dependent on how the colors are carried along the wrong side of the work. The float of the dominant color should be carried below the non-dominant color. Typically, and as is the case in this pattern, the “non-dominant” color serves as the background color. The sample is knit with CC held dominant, which helps the Party Flags motif pop out more against the background.

We recommend breaking yarn at each color change to avoid long vertical floats along the inside of your work. You may wish to weave in your ends as you to go to save time.

For your convenience, we have created four separate charts outlining the Party Flags motif. These charts are intended to help you customize your socks in any way you wish! Chart A reflects the colors used in the sample pictured. Chart B shows the motif in two colors: a dark background with a light foreground. Chart C also shows the motif in two colors, but with a light background and dark foreground. Finally, Chart D is fully customizable! Color changes are outlined, but not filled in so that you can color the chart to match the shades you’ve chosen for your project. You may follow any of these charts for the Party Flags motif.

“One of the best ways to drain people’s energy nowadays is via the internet.”
This toe-up sock begins with sensual cables in a dramatic color that are drained of their energy and eventually give way to boring ribbing in a plain color. It was inspired by Colin Robinson from What We Do in the Shadows.
This pattern was originally released as part of Super Sock Scarefest 2022.

This sock is knitted from the bottom up and has a short-row heel with optional mini-gusset. It features a cable motif in the main color that gradually transitions to a ribbed pattern in the contrast color.
Solids or tonals work best for this pattern. I also recommend a deeper/bolder color for MC and a plain/neutral color for CC.

Both charts and written instructions are provided. Please check the Table of Contents before printing to avoid printing sizes you don’t need!

Sometimes you need a lot of warm, quick-to-knit socks for the whole family—here is a pattern that will work nicely for all the members of the family. 

There are some special features in this pattern that will be appreciated by veteran and novice knitters alike: the simple 2x2 rib pattern is continued across the instep, making the sock quite elastic, stretching to fit a range of widths. The length of both the top and the foot can be adjusted to suit your preference. The back-of-heel texture is continued under the heel to help make your socks last longer, and finally, the toe is a simple spiral, eliminating the need to graft the top of the toe.

The name for this pattern was inspired by a good friend’s delightful Lab, Happy Camper! She is a new mother to our soon-to-be new puppy! (And also because this pattern will make the best camping socks ever!)

1311880,Painted Waves Socks,Oakwood Knits,3.0,34.0,4.0,colorwork stockinette stitch,464.0,"Perfect for stash-busting yarns or mini sets, these scrappy socks are designed to be very versatile depending on how many colors you want to use and how much colorwork you want to do. You can use as few as two colors up to however many colors you want, even using a different color for every chart repeat, for a truly scrappy sock! 

Make Style 1 (sample 1) if you want only some colorwork on your sock - mostly on the leg plus a small decoration at the end of the foot, with the rest of the sock knit in relaxing stockinette stitch. Make Style 2 (samples 2 & 3) if you want to work the colorwork over the entire sock. You’ll get different looks depending on if you alternate just two colors, change colors every chart repeat (pink & red sample, which alternates five colors) or change colors after every two chart repeats while holding one color throughout (dark brown sample).

**Construction**
These socks are knit cuff-down starting with a 2x2 rib, followed by the colorwork pattern over the leg. Follow Style 1 directions to make your sock only with colorwork on the leg, followed by stockinette stitch, and finishing with a colorwork detail at the end of the foot. Follow Style 2 directions to work colorwork over the entire sock. Both styles use a shadow wrap short row heel, in which you don’t need to wrap the stitches, but you can use another heel method if you prefer.

**Sizes**
Small (Medium, Large, X-Large) / 56 (64, 72, 80) sts
To fit foot circumference: 8 (9, 10, 11)” / 20.5 (23, 25.5, 28) cm

**Yarn**
Any sock yarn will work as long as you obtain gauge. I used Campfiber Yarns Vibrant 80/20 Fingering, and Birch Grove 80/20 Fingering (Style 1 sample), Sewrella Yarn 80/20 Nylon Sock (Style 2 pink & red sample), and Handful of Yarn 75/25 Sock plus Birch Grove 80/20 Fingering (Style 2 dark brown sample). 

Each color repeat in pattern uses approx 3 (4, 5, 5) g / 12 (16, 20, 20) yds / 12 (16, 19, 19) m of yarn.

Total yardage needed for both socks: 72 (86, 102, 116) g / 288 (344, 408, 464) yds / 271 (324, 384, 437) m

A Sock Broker.* 

Description: 
This is the lighter weight version of the original Sock Broker pattern. Sock Broker is geared towards adventurous beginners and advanced knitters looking for something simple but interesting - and everyone in between!

This dad joke named pattern was inspired by a specific request from my father. Socks of a certain leg height that are just loose enough to be comfortable around the house but not falling off and not too tight. The combination of the welted rib for the instep stitches with stockinette for the sole provides this just right in between fit.

**Supplies**

**Yarn:** 463 yds, 100 grams

One standard sized skein of fingering weight yarn will make a pair of these socks as written for most sizes. A second skein may be needed for the largest size depending on any adjustments made to leg length. 

Recommended Yarns:
Cozy Cauldron Soft Sock, 463 yards, 3 ply, 75% 19.5 micron extrafine SW Merino, 25% Nylon

Note: More or less yarn may be required if making a smaller size or larger than the smallest or largest size of this pattern. Variations to leg height and foot length will also impact yardage needed.

**Needle(s):** US1/2.25mm (or size needed to achieve gauge) in the type preferred for sock knitting (DPN, small circulars, magic loop). Pattern is written assuming the use of small circulars with the use of DPNs for picking up gusset stitches and working heel flap. 

**Notions:** Stitch Markers (3), needle for weaving in ends, preferred row counting tool (if any)

**Gauge:** Approx 8 stitches per inch in stockinette

**Finished Measurements**
**Sizes**
Small (Medium, Large, X-Large, XX-Large).

**Fit foot circumference:**
7-8” (8-9”, 9-10”, 10-11”, 11-12”)

**Size Notes:**
The circumference above factors in allowance for about 1”-1.5” of negative ease around the foot.
The number of rows worked for the leg and foot may need to be adjusted based on individual preferences and size needs.

These socks are named for Francie Nolan, the main character in my favorite book, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. Like the book, and like Francie, the socks are full of unexpected beauty and character. There are stories hidden in their folds, interesting shapes to be found in their bark, and new ideas to be found in their branches.


These socks were designed with an adventurous knitter in mind. While the leg of the socks is easier to execute than it might appear at first glance, the foot of the socks involves shaping that is probably new to most sock knitters. This shaping results in interesting curves in new places, a foot-hugging contour that surpasses the comfortable clinging power of most traditional ribbed socks, and a new way to shape a toe. The socks may take a bit more concentration than you’re used to, particularly once you get to the foot, but once you find the rhythm of these socks everything should fall into place.


These socks were knit with Dream In Color Smooshy, at 8 stitches per inch, on U.S. size 1 (2.25 mm) DPNs. It is a top-down pattern, and includes instructions for magic loop and 2-circs, if you prefer those tools to DPNs.  You can use any sock yarn you like, preferably in a solid or nearly-solid color. This sock is very stretchy, and will fit a wide range of foot sizes. You can easily customize the fit of the leg and foot by changing needle sizes, to make the circumference a bit wider or a bit narrower. Because the entire sock is based on 2x2 ribbing, the sizing range is generously large. There are instructions in the pattern for customizing the length of the leg and foot of the sock.

Because these socks are a bit different than your average socks, those of you who have knit socks before will have an easier time with this pattern. There is no one skill in these socks that is difficult, but they may take more concentration than your average sock pattern until you get into their unique rhythm. Those of you who can read your knitting (see the difference between knit and purl stitches) will have an easier time with this pattern, although I try to give as much instruction as is reasonably possible. I found them really fun to knit, because I was doing things I'd never quite done before, and it was exciting to see how it would all turn out in the end!

**Zipper + entrelac + hexagon = Ziprelaxagon!**  
These socks make the most of painted yarns. 

This is an 11-page pattern with charts, diagram, full written instructions in three sizes (with an option to work sizes in between), many photos of the construction, and links to helpful videos.

**What’s fun about this pattern**
Painted yarns show their colors.  Say goodbye to weaving in ends (almost) because the units and cuff are connected in one continuous strand, entrelac-style.  Only the toe is a separate piece.  There’s no grafting or seaming.  *[The Zipper][1]* is a fun way to close up each colorful unit.  Fit can be customized.

**What’s challenging about this pattern**
This pattern is for advanced and adventurous knitters.  Knitting in multiple directions and dimensions will reward you with beautiful socks.  The units become familiar with practice, but the shaping of the heel will keep you thinking.  

**What you should know before you begin**
It will be helpful to have worked entrelac or any form of modular knitting.  These socks are a cousin to both.  You should be comfortable with working in the round on small needles, either circular or double-pointed.  And, as my fortune cookie said this year, ""A handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains.""

**Some notes on construction**
The hexagon units are worked first, starting from the toe and continuously through the heel and up to the cuff.  Then the knitter has the option to either finish the cuff and go back to the afterthought toe, or start the toe and finish the cuff last.  It all depends on your yarn-conservation needs.  Instructions are given for shorter or narrower feet, for eliminating a tier of hexagons, or for adding a tier to extend the calf.  The sole and heel can be worked smooth instead of textured, if desired.

Start at the toe and knit on up to the top… then hang a left turn and work the cuff sideways. Slipped stitches and unfussy lace pair with garter stitch to create a graphic design reminiscent of grapevines. The cuff is worked mostly in garter stitch, which produces nicely snug and elastic socks. Included in the eMag is a video tutorial by Eunny Jang on the sideways cuff technique.

Designed to be an easily memorized and addictive pattern, but not boring.

This pattern is designed for an average adult woman’s foot, but sizing up or down can be obtained by changing needle size or by decreasing the number of stitches on each side of the chevrons.

The gauge listed is for stockinette stitch. Due to the bias nature of the chevrons in this pattern, the gauge tends to be a bit tighter in the pattern portion of the sock--requiring 72 stitches.

*“Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue, and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.” - Dorothy Gale, The Wizard of Oz*

Dorothy Gale dreams of a magical world that lies just beyond the rainbow. These top-down socks use MothyAndTheSquid rainbow mini skeins to create your own magical footwear. Knit with only one color at a time, these socks use the simple technique of slipping stitches to give the appearance of stranded colorwork. There are no wrapped stitches and the pattern is both charted and written, making this sock much simpler than it looks. This pattern is perfect for working with sock scraps or a good excuse to buy those mini skeins you’ve been eyeing. Use similar colors to create your own fade or high contrast colors for socks that stand out. No matter where you’re going, these socks will always take you Somewhere!

Updated and expanded, this delightful new edition of Silk Road Socks features sixteen intricate patterns inspired by oriental rugs.

All fourteen of the original patterns are here, each revised to fit my current style and with extra sizes added (that includes sizing them all for both fingering weight yarn and dk/sport weight yarn).  There are also two brand new patterns available here for the first time ever.  And of course along the way I’ve upgraded all the fun bits (new photos, new charts, beautiful illustrations…all the things that help make a book lovely)!

Every paper copy of the book includes a unique code (look inside the back cover) that allows you to download a copy of the electronic book.  You'll be able to store the electronic version in your ravelry library if you like (though a ravelry membership isn't required to access the electronic version).

*Usak (sometimes Ushak) is a city in eastern Turkey where rugs have been made since at least the fifteenth century. Because rugs have been produced there for centuries, and because eastern Turkey is fairly close to Europe, many of the carpets first brought to Europe were from this area.*

*Usak rugs (and Turkish rugs in general) often use a different color palette than do Persian rugs. They use less blue and red and more brown, yellow, and rust. Usak rugs combine this color scheme with a characteristic floral motif. The color and stylized floral design of this sock reflect this distinctive style.*

*“‘`Curiouser and curiouser!’ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English)...’” - Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*

Alice’s curiosity leads to quite an adventure as she makes her way down the rabbit hole. These socks are an adventure of their own, with simple techniques that lead to unexpected results. Beginning at the toe, twisted rib stitches work their way up the foot of the sock. Decreases in pattern paired with yarnovers create unexpected winding pathways and lace that curiously resemble the eyes appearing in the forest that Alice encounters. Twisted rib continues up the leg of the sock, where the lace pattern shifts to the sides of the sock leg. Worked in Tanis Fiber Arts ‘Seabreeze,’ this design highlights the tonal qualities of the yarn and uses predictable lace patterns to create an easy-to-work sock with dramatic impact.

904939,Essential Boot Socks,Maddy Moe,2.7,32.0,4.0,"Stockinette stitch, worked flat",400.0,"This free pattern is meant to act as an all-inclusive guide for some common methods for knitting a sock heel. Going into this project I had only done the classic heel flap method myself, but I had wanted to learn some new techniques for a long time – both the short row and afterthought heels proved very easy to pick up, and I was so excited to learn them that I just had to pass on the love. Here I present these three methods for a sock heel (including the heel flap, the short row heel, and the afterthought heel) with detailed instructions and visuals for each method. I hope that you enjoy knitting them as much as I did.

In this pattern I also included one of my favorite design elements: the folded cuff. While it is an optional element, I provide instructions for knitting a permanently folded sock cuff which is worked using a provisional cast on and later joined. It works up a bit tighter than a regular sock cuff for a sock that doesn’t slouch down to your ankle.

**Note**: *A kind raveler brought it to my attention that the afterthought heel method that I describe is traditionally called the forethought heel - a true afterthought heel involves knitting a long continuous tube for the length of the ankle and the foot, then picking up sts along two rows and cutting the knitting between these rows. I  have decided to leave this pattern as is because it seems to me that the definition of the afterthought heel has evolved a bit over time, but I have since published another free sock pattern with a true afterthought heel tutorial :) Introducing, the [Kettle Chip Socks][1]!*

*****

**Dimensions**:  7 (8, 9)” circumference at widest part of foot, and several inches above ankle

* These values are rough measurements – socks are flexible! Don’t sweat the gauge or the measurements too much, and if in doubt – round up a size for roomier socks, round down a size for more fitting socks.

* Cuff is meant to be tighter than most socks, and the leg a bit longer to be worn with boots.

**Needles**:

* Size US 1/2.25 mm DPNs or circular needles long enough for magic loop

* Size US 2/2.75 mm DPNs or circular needles long enough for magic loop

* (optional) Size US 1 or smaller circular or double pointed knitting needles, any length

*“Actually, I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.” 
– Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*

Hermione Granger is well-known to be the smartest in her year. She is diligent about her studies, but her friends find her to also be knowledgeable, responsible, and downright precocious. These toe-up socks use yarnover increases for both the toe and gusset. Worked on top of the foot, these create distinctive design details that are also very useful for the sock construction. Twisted ribbing and reverse stockinette play back and forth in this design which any sock knitter will find is, like Hermione herself, Cleverly Practical.

**Notes:** This top-down colourwork sock features contrast-coloured 1x1 twisted rib on the cuff and a colourwork pattern on the leg, starting with a few stripes before moving into a simplified geometric feather design. The flap and gusset heel and the foot are worked in the main colour, and then the stripes repeat just before the toe, which is knit in the same yarn as the cuff ribbing.
Some knitters find they need to go up a needle size to maintain gauge in the colourwork section.

be intimidating to knit. Elongated stitches showcase them
perfectly—creating a long bright stitch on top of darker
ones, or the reverse, is such a delight!

Pistachio socks are knit from the cuff down, with a pattern
of elongated stitches that fans out from the center and
disappears the same way. After working the eye-of-partridge
heel flap, the stitch pattern is repeated again on the foot,
ending with a wedge toe.

The Vee stitches will grow outwards from the center of the
instep and back of leg. New repeats are offset from previous
ones by 2 stitches in either direction. Each 4-row repeat
adds one more Vee to the previous repeat. This happens
on both instep and back of the leg, until eventually the two
expanding patterns meet. Then the Vees start to disappear
from the center of the instep/back of leg out. This is
accomplished by working only half of each stitch (Vee-R
and Vee-L) in the center, expanding in either direction by
2 stitches each repeat.",4.99,17,18,0.0,"7"" x 8.75"", 8"" x 9.25"", 9"" x 9.5"", 10"" circumference x 10"" foot length",Fingering

Knit in two colors of DK weight yarn, the color play in these socks creates a subtle zigzag effect, even though you’re neither zigging nor zagging. 

The twisted texture is not only a feast for your eyes, and a treat for your feet, but also a great tactile experience for your hands as well.  I dare you not to become obsessed with running your fingers over the bumpy texture when the socks are finished.

And finished they will be, because with an easily memorizable pattern, these socks will fly off your needles and you’ll be done before…

Heavy weight wool socks are a cold climate favorite! Wear them outside in your boots or inside on chilly floors. They make quick knitting and great gifts, but knitters won’t find much variety in the patterns available. This easy-to-knit pattern adds to that variety, as well as being designed specifically to go with Knitwise Design’s [Country Waffles Hat][2] and [Transition Zone Cardigan][3]. You can knit yourself a whole ensemble!

This pattern is appropriate for intermediate knitters familiar with knitting socks. The socks are worked in the round, on dpns, from the cuff down, though if you are adept at magic loop you will find it easy to adapt it to that technique as well. The pattern is three pages long and has been test knit and professionally tech edited to be clear and free of errors.

20 sts/ 35 rnds/ 4 in/ 10 cm in waffle stitch pattern in the rnd as on given in pattern.
18 sts/35 rnds/ 4 in/ 10 cm in Garter Rib in the rnd as given in pattern.

**What You Need:**

* Briggs and Little “Tuffy” (80% pure wool, 20% nylon; 215 yds/196 m per 4 oz/ 113g skein); 2 (2 ,2) skeins, OR a comparable aran weight yarn. Exact yardage used will depend on leg and foot length knit. Size S for a child’s shoe size may need only 1 skein. Shown in color “Rosewood”. 

* One set of dpns in size required to obtain gauge. I used US #5/ 3.75 mm. You may need a size or two above or below that. 

*  One stitch marker

* Tapestry needle

**What size do I knit?**
If you will be wearing your socks alone you can choose a size that has up to 1 in/ 2.5 cm (circumference) negative ease (smaller than foot). If you plan to layer your heavy socks over another pair of socks, choose a size with no ease or up to 1 in/ 2.5 cm positive ease (larger than foot).

Tuffy yarn is available in the US through mail order from [Maritime Family Fiber.][4]

I like to design the socks with an eye to what the character might like to knit. Kitty Bennet is a bit annoying and impatient, but she likes pretty things. I imagine her being able to follow a simple, easily memorizable lace pattern that's easy to read and produces a nice effect without a whole lot of effort.

These socks are worked from the cuff down and include three sizes for fingering-weight yarns as well as a bonus DK version of the pattern. They are written for magic-loop knitting and include a heel flap and gusset, but feel free to substitute your own needle preference and preferred heel/toe method. You could easily work these socks toe up, although you would need to flip the lace chart upside-down.

You should be able to knit a pair of these socks for most foot sizes in fingering weight with approx. 100g of yarn. I knit the shorties (darker speckled green sample) in 50g of light fingering weight and the DK (light green sample) in 100g of DK to fit approx. a women's 7.5.

I’m on a mission to fill every sock drawer in the world with beautiful, hand-knit socks!! I felt the only way to achieve this mission was to design socks that EVERYONE could feel successful at knitting. 

I do realize that turning a heel and knitting a gusset aren’t the worst things in the world, (in fact, some knitters really enjoy that step,) but I’ve always dreaded it, and it was the one thing that prevented me from knitting all the socks. 

CHOOSING YOUR SOCK SIZE:	
It’s very important to have negative ease and a snug fitting sock when knitting The Magic Heel Socks. One tip is to knit the main body of your sock in the needle size stated in the pattern and then knit the heel section in a needle that is one size smaller.
*If you want to get really accurate, measure your foot circumference around the ball of your foot (the padded area just under your toes) and measure the area around your heel and ankle (round to the nearest ¼”/.5 cm). Use the larger of these 2 numbers and multiply by .95 – this should be the finished circumference of your socks.

What exactly are the BENEFITS of knitting Magic Heel Socks? 
I’m so glad you asked!
1. No finicky heel means these socks are a complete joy to knit, especially for beginner or nervous sock knitters!
2. Knit toe-up, (but easily adjustable to be knit cuff-down). 
3. They’re ideal if you’re using self-striping yarn because your stripes will be uninterrupted. 
4. They’re perfect for fast-growing children’s feet because they’re quick to knit and the heel can accommodate multiple sizes. 
5. They make the best gift knits, especially when you’re not exactly sure what size feet your recipient has. The best way to keep them a surprise!
6. When your socks finally wear out, you can easily mend them by cutting your sock, (just above or below the worn area) picking up the live stitches and then re-knitting your sock down or up. You’ll get twice as much wear out of your Magic Heel socks this way.

Knit cuff-down with a hemmed picot cast-on, heel flap/gussett, and wedge toe.  The cables continue down to border the heel flap.  There are instructions on mirroring the pattern on each foot.

Both written and charted instructions provided.

The original sock was knit with Claudia Hand Painted which has low yardage.  If your foot is longer than 9 1/2"" or if you need to knit a larger sock, you will need 3 skeins of yarn instead of 2.  If you use a different yarn with more yardage, you should be able to knit the socks with 100 grams.

Size of sock can get adjusted by knitting with a needle ONE size smaller or larger to obtain a different gauge.

There are so many things to love and enjoy about the Weasley Family as described in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter Series.

This sock is knit from the cuff down and features a staggered rib and a slip stitch heel.

Note Feb 28, 2011:  This pattern was  translated into German by Angelika Hampl of Hobbyschneiderin, but it is no longer available at the link provided.

**From the description:**

> With so many wonderful dyers in our
> midst, I find myself spinning many
> painted rovings, winding vibrant
> colors onto my drop spindles.
> Navajo-plied for strength and for
> boldness of color, the spun rovings
> make wonderful striped sock yarn. 
> Eventually I tire of stripes, but
> because I love the plying, I seek ways
> to divert the stripes into something
> more random, something surprising.
> 
> These socks are the cure for stripe
> boredom. The shifting colors in the
> yarn undulate into waves that curve
> like drifting autumn leaves, or
> distant hills at sunset. For
> definition and relief (both visual and
> mental), the waves are separated by ridges of garter stitch. Knitters who challenge themselves to learn backward knitting will speed
 through the pattern’s many short rows. The leg width is dependent upon the number of pattern repeats, but is
 stretchy and forgiving. The shifting
 pattern repeat means these socks are best knit on double-pointed needles.

I wanted a pattern that would ""play"" with the wild colors of yarns from dyers like Blue Moon FiberArts.  It took many tries before I found this faux cable stitch which seems to work well with almost any colorway from the wild variegate, solid, tonal to the self striping.

The sock is knit cuff down starting with ribbing which flows into the faux cable pattern; EOP heel flap is edged with a garter stitch border.  The gusset decreases are placed to follow the line of the bottom of the heel.  Pattern continues down the instep and ends in a wedge toe.  The socks can be knit mirrored (fraternal).  

Pattern includes both written instructions and charts.  

Gauge for small size is 8.5 sts/11 rows per inch.

Sample is shown in a BMFA mill end (I think it's Knitters without Borders).  Medium size with 9 3/4 inch foot required 310 yards.

Inspired by the Astaire/Rogers movie *Follow the Fleet* (RKO, 1936), these socks feature an elegant design drawn with elongated, slipped stitches on a stockinette background. The steps are easy to learn -- twirl, release, slide -- and in no time you’ll be putting them together in graceful, elegant choreography.

Pattern is written for three sizes: men’s small (medium, large), to fit mid-foot circumference 8.5 (9.5, 10.5) inches.

The collection features 8 patterns intended to make good gifts for everyone on your knitworthy list (because life’s too short to knit for anyone who doesn’t love what you make).

**Hugni**
I’ve spent my whole life living in old buildings with draughty wooden floors — there can never be enough thick woolly socks in the wintertime. Worked in a sturdy wool nylon blend in an unusually heavy weight for a sock yarn Hugni will keep your toes warm and should hold up well to be even if you spend as much time sliding down the hallway as I did as a small child. The cuffs feature a simple stranded colourwork pattern and the contrast colour is used for both heels and toes for a classic boot sock look. The pattern is written in two lengths, with calf shaping on the longer length. Extra squishy heels are worked in a traditional heel stitch pattern combining short row shaping and a gusset for a better fit, especially for high insteps. Hugni is worked from the top down and is given in three sizes.  

**Yarn**

Ready for a sock that will keep you on your toes? These Celtic Climbers may look challenging, but a predictable lace repeat creates a lovely dramatic effect without too much effort. The lacy Celtic design begins at the toe and climbs up the leg, while 3x1 ribbing on the rest of the foot makes for a perfect fit. Worked symmetrically, each foot becomes a mirror image of the other.

829466,Safe Harbor,Amy Rapp,3.69,8.0,1.0,,,"Last September, Hurricane Irma stopped over for a visit. Waiting for the storm to hit, watching for the slightest twist or turn in its path that would mean the difference between a direct hit and a near miss, hoping for changes in strength or in how far out from the center the hurricane force winds extended was highly stressful. And then the storm hit. Winds howled around us. Rain pounded down so hard we couldn’t see the house across the street. Tornados appeared one after another after another, eight of them in the space of two hours. Power went out about halfway through, and stayed out for three days. 

Designing this sock was how I kept myself from panic. Determining the number of stitches, modifying the stitch patterns to use in the round, choosing the heel and toe, knitting the sock and writing the pattern. This sock kept my concentration off the rapidly approaching storm and helped me to get through it. It truly was a Safe Harbor for me. ",,739,244,4.73,Women’s medium,Fingering

The instep of a sock is an important part of sock construction – so why not highlight it? Introducing the Step In Sock: the cozy color-blocked sock that emphasizes your instep. 

This basic sock is knit from the toe up and features a gusset on the bottom of the foot and a turned heel, heel flap, and instep in a contrast color. Much of the sock is in glorious (and quick!) stockinette. Only one color is used at a time, so there is no complicated color management.

**What test knitters had to say:**

* ""I liked watching the construction of the heel - I couldn't fathom how the gusset was the gusset and then BAM! I had a heel flap and gusset from toe up. I also desperately needed something just beyond vanilla in my life and this project was excellent at meeting that need.""
* ""I really enjoyed the heel flap - I liked it a lot more than the traditional picking up stitches along the flap.""
* ""It was fun to knit, with colour changes you’re always eager to keep going. Am grateful you wrote the jogless join into the pattern, makes for a nicer looking finished product.""
* ""I can imagine so many fun colour blocking combos being put together for this pattern.""

<hr><hr><hr>

In the summer of 2022, I realized that maintaining a back catalog of hundreds of patterns was kind of overwhelming. I couldn’t do it and still release new things. So I took my old patterns down so I could keep doing new work. 

Since then, a handful of my favorites have [come back][11], and lovely new things have [come out][12]. But *the vast majority of the old patterns are retired and will no longer be generally available*.

***However, enough folks have asked about some old favorites that I’m planning to make many of the retired patterns available for a few days once or twice a year (most likely in late spring and then again in the fall around Thanksgiving).***

I shouldn’t admit this, because it’s going to make at least a few of you deeply uncomfortable, but I find myself unspeakably fascinated with the strands of kelp and seaweed that cling tight to the rocks. They always look just the tiniest bit alien, especially the kinds with row after row of tiny air chambers (they help the seaweed float so it gets enough light to grow). This stitch captures a bit of that feeling but without any danger of something cold and slimy brushing against your ankle!

Just a quick word of warning, these socks absolutely will take more yarn than you might expect. The dip stitches are beautiful (and so much fun to do), but they do use up quite a bit of yarn. So if you have bigger feet, or if you like a tall leg on your socks, consider looking for a generous skein of yarn. And maybe unravel your swatch, just to be safe!",,20,51,0.0,"Fits a foot or leg of 6.25 [7.75, 9.25, 10.75]  inches in fingering-weight yarn, 7.5  [9.5, 11.25, 13.25] inches  in sport or dk-weight yarn.",Light Fingering

It took me a while to get the combination of stitch pattern and yarn that I wanted for this design, but I am so very, very happy with the end result. Zinderella is a type of zinnia, and something about the ""petal"" appearance of this stitch pattern reminded me of those more frilly varieties of this beautiful flower.

Whether you play the game or just enjoy the look as much as I do, I hope you enjoy knitting up a pair of these cozy color work socks.

Sizes: S (M,L)
Relaxed width: 7¼(8 ⅛, 9) inches
Max width when stretched at cuff: 10(11 ¼, 12 ½) inches

Please choose a size that has a relaxed width that is the same as, or slightly smaller than the circumference of your foot. If you are outside the sizing chart, you can also add or remove a repeat of the charts to accommodate your size. At gauge, each 8 stitch repeat adds just under (about 9/10) of an inch. Adjust foot length to suit by adding rows just before starting the toe. Please be aware that changing the width or length of your sock will change your yarn usage as well. Suggestions for making sure you have a properly-fitting sock are found in the ‘Notes’ section below.

*These yardages include 15% extra for differences in knitting and length of foot, as well as for yarn tails from joining and breaking colors*

Needles: US 1 (2.25mm) needles for ribbing and sections worked in stockinette, US 1.5 (2.5mm) for color work. I suggest using Magic Loop method, or a set of DPNs. 

Gauge: 35sts and 38 rows is 4”x4” in color work (not stretched) with US 1.5 (2.5mm). Use the needles that you need to achieve gauge. 

Notes:
- Because the color work on the cuff is least stretchy section of these socks, I HIGHLY suggest trying on your sock after completing the first 15 or so rounds of Chart A to ensure your beautiful new socks will actually fit.
- A tip for placing your afterthought heel- consider putting both sets of live stitches on life lines. Andrea Mowry’s awesome video on the technique can be found here: (https://youtu.be/t00Vosm62Iw) This can both give you peace of mind that your live stitches won’t disappear and make it easier to knit a sock of the correct length. Removing the waste yarn for the heel while the live stitches are still safely on life lines allows you to try your sock on and get a much more accurate feel for any adjustments that can be made. I suggest altering the number of rows in C1 before beginning the toe if you find you need longer/shorter socks.",,18,110,4.6,"S(M,L)",Fingering

These patterns are meant for times when you want a mostly mindless knitting project you can pick up and put down easily, but also want something a little more interesting than a plain vanilla sock - hence, the ""Vanilla Sundae"" name. All 6 patterns are also available together in an ebook for the best total price! The ebook also comes with a **BONUS 15-page Vanilla Sock Recipe** written for both cuff-down and toe up constructions, an expanded 12 sizes, guidance on how to adjust sizing for your own stitch and round gauge, as well as plenty of other tips so that you can create handknit socks you will actually wear! I hope you enjoy these sock patterns, and happy knitting!

The texture formed by the purl bumps in these textured colorwork socks reminded me of the tiny sprinkles on top of a cake pop. These socks are worked using mosaic knitting, so only one color is held at a time. In between the mosaic sections, there is a break of several easy rounds of stockinette stitch. A single garter stitch ridge decorates the top of the contrast toe. These socks are fun to work to work as a mismatched set with two contrast colors. Three children sizes and four adult sizes are included in this pattern.

**Construction**
These socks are knit cuff-down, starting with a 2x2 ribbed cuff followed by mosaic colorwork on the leg. The heel is worked as a shadow wrap short row heel, and then the mosaic colorwork is resumed on the foot. The bumpy texture is maintained on the top of the foot, but the CC is knit on the bottom of the foot so that it is smooth. There is a decorative garter ridge at the top of the contrast toe.

**Please note:** If your shaping decreases meet the heel decreases and you still have too many stitches, skip the heel decreases on the round where the two meet, and continue both decreases until your stitch count is correct.

The delightful mix of increases and decreases gives you the look of mock cables, without all of the extra work. Not too many holes, so it keeps your feet nice and cozy. 

It’s a fairly simple pattern, but truly delightful. Being an owner of so many different brightly variegated yarns, I wanted to design something that worked well with them and looked nice with a little consistent pooling. I know, I know, some people think pooling is evil. But really, could you honestly tell me that’s ugly pooling and mean it? I think it goes well with brightly colored yarns, but it would also bring out the slight differences in darker toned semi-solids as well.

Maeby is one of three patterns bundled together in the [Fünke Socks collection, available as a set for $12][1].

Like billowing clouds, this sock design builds on itself, layer upon layer. Not your ordinary toe-up sock, this one begins with an overgrown magic cast-on from which two scallop shapes are formed. Each subsequent scallop is made from stitches picked up along the edges of previous ones. The heel construction is far from average, with two extra-large scallops emerging from a long, thin heel flap of sorts (the tail of the previous scallop from the bottom of the foot). Short-rows are employed to create the heel as well as to even out the curved top edge in preparation for the ribbed cuff. This pattern is ideal for hand-dyed yarns because the constantly changing stitch count minimizes the risk of striking or pooling colors.

*“Just follow the Yellow Brick Road,” - Glinda, The Wizard of Oz*

“It’s always best to start at the beginning,” as the Good Witch of the North would say. What better way than to begin at the toe? With this sock you will journey up the foot to gusset increases and a heel flap, then trek your way up to the cuff. A simple textured rib stitch creates golden pathways that lead the way up the foot of the socks, while the leg combines slipped stitches with simple knit and purl to create an avenue of yellow bricks. The adventure is highlighted by Leading Men Fiber Arts’ Spotlight base, with BFL wool providing both luster and durability for your feet. The adventure is waiting, so grab your needles-- it’s time to “Just Follow the Yellow Brick Road!”

Here is a sock that satisfies all my loves but also reflects all my indecisions.  May all your ""indecisions"" be fun.

Designed for [Tour-de-Sock][1] 2017 competition, Stage 3.  Tour de Sock benefits Doctors without Borders. From now until the end of Tour (September 15, 2017), I will donate $3 from the sale of each pattern  to Doctors Without Borders.

Socks are knit top down with the option of a ribbed cuff or a hemmed picot cuff.  The leg features a fun cable and lace motif.  The socks have a traditional heel flap/gusset construction with a choice of a modifed EOP with garter stitch border or a patterned flap.  There is a choice of either continuing the cable/lace motif on the instep or replacing that with ribbing.  The cables can be easily mirrored for symmetrical socks.

The pattern has both written instructions and charts.

Shown in BMFA, Socks That Rock, Lt. Weight, Blue Brick Wall colorway.  The medium pair with ribbed cuff, plain heel, patterned instep, 9-1/2 inch foot length required about 375 yds.

Thank you to BMFA for providing yarn support.

Updated and expanded, this delightful new edition of Silk Road Socks features sixteen intricate patterns inspired by oriental rugs.

All fourteen of the original patterns are here, each revised to fit my current style and with extra sizes added (that includes sizing them all for both fingering weight yarn and dk/sport weight yarn).  There are also two brand new patterns available here for the first time ever.  And of course along the way I’ve upgraded all the fun bits (new photos, new charts, beautiful illustrations…all the things that help make a book lovely)!

Every paper copy of the book includes a unique code (look inside the back cover) that allows you to download a copy of the electronic book.  You'll be able to store the electronic version in your ravelry library if you like (though a ravelry membership isn't required to access the electronic version).

*Mood (sometimes Muud or Moud) is a small town in eastern Iran. It has a long textile history, and rugs from the area are generally considered to be of a very high quality.*

*Mood rugs use several different designs but share some common characteristics. The background of these rugs nearly always features a small-scale, closely-packed, repeated motif. This creates an almost tiled effect that is very soothing despite the intricate design. These socks build on this idea by repeating a single simple element across the entire sock.*

How do you find the word that means Maria?
A **flibbertijibbet**! A will-o’-the wisp! A clown!” 
- The Nuns, *The Sound of Music**

Flibbertigibbet is a top-down sock featuring complex cables, simple lace, and uniquely placed garter stitch. It begins with a scalloped cast-on. Ribbing gives way to cables and lace, both charted and written, that work their way down the leg. A slip-stitch heel provides durability, while a gusset placed on the bottom of the heel creates a unique look for this fancy footwear. Worked in a solid or semi-solid colorway, this sock transforms the yarn into something both whimsical and wearable, while highlighting the undeniable skill of a proficient sock knitter.

• 250 (340, 410) yards of Fingering Weight Yarn

For users of Mindless Knits Socks yarn , this pattern does call for a relatively close match of gauge in order for the foot colors to line up correctly.  There is some “wiggle” room in the toe color, so if you find that you cannot match gauge exactly, the yarn may
still work within reason.

**Sock Construction**: Toe-up, rounded toe, basic gusset heel, patterned instep, ribbed cuff

Foot, leg and cuff are knit to fit; adding length will increase the yardage needed. 

I used Brooklyn Tweed Loft for the sample socks shown in the pattern.  Thanks to yarn support from Brooklyn Tweed, I was able to try using this yarn for socks, knowing that they will be well used and subject to wear. Loft is a lightweight, woolen spun yarn with moderate texture and some elasticity.  It is not traditionally featured as a sock yarn, but I'm very pleased with the way it bloomed after blocking.  **Pro Tip** - I hand-felted the bottom of each sock in the areas where I tend to put the most wear (heels and toes).  If you use this yarn, I highly recommend it, keeping this information in mind.  You may also want to read more about Brooklyn Tweed worsted and woolen spun selections; there's great information [on their website at this link.][1]

As with all my designs, my hope is that you'll use this pattern as a guide and then make this project your own.

Okay, I’ll admit it… I’ve been on a weird quest to design a pattern starting with every letter of the alphabet. X is one of my last challenges, so out came the old Scrabble dictionary, which defines Xeric as “(of an environment or habitat) containing little moisture; very dry; ‘xeric conditions.’” I love dry feet! If you do, too, you’ll enjoy these socks: they’re easy-peasy, knit from the cuff down, with a great-fitting heel flap and gusset, and just enough simple changing K and P texture to keep you interested.

**What test knitters had to say:**

* ""I appreciated the well written pattern and the ease of the stitches.  Nothing tricky or complex, nice heel to turn as well.""
* ""I think I’ve found a great new guy pattern...my husband immediately started hinting that he could use a pair.""
* ""I had a great time working on these socks. No difficult stitches but required just enough concentration to be soothing.""

Summer Heat was designed with burning hot days of California weather in mind. The up and down movement of the ‘v’ stitch pattern reminds me of heat waves coming off the roofs, the side walk, cars, pavement, etc… 

Summer Heat is designed from the top cuff down and has a fun slip stitch pattern to create the ‘v’ stitches. I like the play of almost variegation with the speckles on top and the stitch pattern, but I think this pattern would also look lovely in a solid color. Take a dive through your stash and cool off from this 'summer heat.'

1191245,A Scrappy Good Time Socks,Crystal Tea Knits,0.0,8.0,4.0,stockinet,,"A Scrappy Good Time Socks is a fun simple pattern that uses stripping and slip stitches to make a beautiful colorwork sock. There are endless possibilities for combinations that no 2 socks will be alike. 

This sock pattern is great for Share A Pair, Mini Sock kits. or Advent Calendar yarns

Here are a few suggestions on variations to the pattern,

* use 1 Main Color and Change Contrasting Color each repeat of 
     pattern
* Use 1 Main Color and a selfstripping yarn for the Contrasting 
     Color
* Use 1 Main Color and 1 Contrasting Color
* Use 1 Main Color and 1 Contrasting Color the switch them 
      when you knit the second sock

The socks are knit cuff down with instructions for a Slip Stitch Heel but, you can easily substitute your favorite heel method. the pattern is written for Magic Loop but I haver included on how to use DPNs and 9""circulars.

I hope you enjoy knitting this pattern as much as I enjoyed designing it.

1194489,Magical Day Socks,Amy Kate Sutherland,2.0,32.0,4.0,stockinette in the round,430.0,"
These textured socks feature hand-dyed yarn by Ruby and Roses Yarn and are specifically designed to beautifully showcase every speckle of color. I hope you enjoy knitting them!

This pattern is written for using the magic loop method, but detailed instructions are provided for substituting any method.

Similarly, this pattern recommends and has written instructions and video tutorials for knitting an afterthought heel. However, instructions are given for you to substitute your preferred heel.

This pattern is written for sizes small(medium, large) and are designed to fit a 7(8, 9) inch foot circumference. Please note that sock fabric has a lot of stretch, and each size will realistically fit 6-8(7-9, 8-10) inch feet. I suggest choosing the size that best suits the amount of negative/positive ease you prefer for socks.

If you ever have any questions, comments, or suggestions for ways to improve my patterns, please do not hesitate to email me (thegracefultangle@gmail.com), DM me on Instagram (@thegracefultangle), private message me on Ravelry (TheGracefulTangle), or message me on Etsy (thegracefultangle). Also, please feel free to sell any items you make using my patterns. I simply ask that you link back to the pattern, or put my information with your listing/tag on the item.

>Isn’t it awful that cold feet make for a cold imagination and that a pair of woolen socks induce good thoughts! ~ Franz Grillparzer, Austrian writer and dramatist

The fact that in the past we have mostly only seen tweeds in darker or more neutral colors makes the new brights seem all the more robust. 

Find the brightest tweed you can and cast on, your feet will be happy and so your day will be brighter.

Adult medium sample socks were knit in Mt. Rusten Studio Little Abbey Fingering Tweed (85% Bluefaced Leicester, 15% Nylon; 438 yds/400m/100g per skein) in colorway Spiced Carrot; weighing 65 g and used 285 yds/260m. You can purchase here: [Etsy][1] 

PATTERN NOTES
Written for both DK and Fingering weight yarns, this collection includes ‘top-down’ socks, cast on at the cuff, then worked in the round on double pointed or circular needles to the heel. 
The Dutch heel flap is worked back and forth in rows, and then the heel is turned. Stitches are picked up along the heel flap, and the work is joined in the round and the gusset stitches decreased. 
The socks are mirror images of each other and thus are worked with the diagonal line crossing in opposite directions.
Each sock in this collection is embellished with an optional pear-shaped button, bead, or charm. 

ERRATA: There is a mistake in stitch count after the heel turn, on page 4, Next Row. It has been corrected. (This should not have affected your ability to knit the sock.) There was also a stitch count error on Rows 2-5 of both the LC and RC socks. Pattern was updated 12/28/21

""What does that mean?""  ""It's old Atlantian. The language of the gods,"" Casteel said, his voice rough. He cleared his throat as he squeezed my hand again. ""Meyaah Liessa. It means: my Queen.”

Once upon a time, I fell deep into the world of Poppy and Casteel and never looked back! As a fantasy fiction lover, I can assure you that the Blood and Ash series is incredible in every way and if you haven’t gotten on the Jennifer L. Armentrout train you are seriously missing out! 

While I was totally immersed in all things Atlantian, I was so inspired to create a sock that embodied Poppy and her title of Meyaah Liessa. It took a few tries (and an entire reread!) but I am so super pleased with how this pattern has turned out. Its everything I wanted and so much more. The lace repeats may seem intimidating at first glance but they are so simple to memorize. The lace also works up remarkably fast which is always a joy! 

These socks are knit cuff down with a modified Eye of Partridge heel flap. There are instructions for both mid calf and ankle (shorty) socks included in the pattern. I hope you enjoy making your Liessa Socks as much as I have enjoyed designing them. Happy knitting!

Available at any time, breathwork restores the weary body and spirit.

As air leaves the body melting away the stress of the day, so, too, do these stitches travel outward and downward to the toe.

These socks were inspired by my Gems in the Window cowl. Someone requested that I turn the design into socks, so here it is! I did need to make some modifications to the pattern repeat to make it work for socks, since sock requirements are a little different than cowl requirements.

These socks are knit with one color at a time.  The socks have the pattern mirrored on the leg, and the slip stitches have been modified so that they won’t make the sock extra tight, as slip stitches have a tendency to do. 

You can use as many or as few CCs as you wish, but it’s perfect for mini skein sets and scraps.  Or try pulling out that wild multi you haven’t figured out a use for yet!

My sample has a striped toe, but you can make the toe in just one CC or even the MC, as you desire.

There seems to be a lot of trouble with the gauge on these socks...  I can get gauge on US 1 with just about most fingering weight yarns.  Some of the thinner ones might even mean going down to a US 0.  This might seem like it's going to be small, but the lace has a great deal of give when the YO's are dropped.

The Gloss sample was knit on US 0, and the pink tencel on US 1.

I suggest you find your gauge in stockinette and use that needle to cast on and work the rib, then work the rest of the foot one size smaller.

The main stitch pattern combines garter stitch and a stockinette wedge, so the stitch count varies from round to round. On the outer side of each sock is a vertical stripe, which creates an interesting visual element and eliminates the visible job created by garter stitch in the round. To match the garter-stitch elements of the main stitch pattern, I used a garter-stitch cuff, short-row heel, and short-row toe.

These reversible socks look great in any yarn but are particularly stunning when made with colorful, hand-painted sock yarn. The purled background with a Twisted-slip rib breaks up color pooling. 

An unusual pattern on the heel adds both texture and color distribution. 

As a final surprise, the ribbing on the foot begins on the outer gussets and twists around to the big toes. 

You can even wear them inside out to show the details on the knit side.You’ll have to choose which side you prefer. It’s a tough choice but either way your feet will look fabulous.

Not only is Twisted reversible and suitable for almost any sock yarn, it also provides an incredibly wide range of sizes for men, women and children. Finally, for a professional finish, directions for making sock blockers are included. 


When choosing sock size keep in mind the following general guidelines:
      
* Children aged 3 to 7 (6 to 11, 10 to 14) years roughly correspond with sizes XXS (XS, S) 
 
* Women’s narrow (average, wide) feet correspond with sizes S (M, L). 
    
* Men’s narrow (average, wide) feet correspond with sizes M (L, XL).

If your sock needs to accommodate proportionally larger ankles or feet prone to swelling (edema) then choose one size larger than you would based on foot width alone.

*Lara Neel of Math 4 Knitters fame featured Twisted in her [podcast][1] in June 2010.  Her show discusses how to substitute a heavier yarn and includes a helpful cheat sheet and an interview with yours truly.  I had a great time chatting with Lara and really like what she has done with my design. Enjoy.  Jodie*

A few hints for successful socks:

* There are two download files. The first contains the pattern instructions and all the charts. The second contains just the charts -- but in an enlarged view for easier reading, cutting, and taping. 
* The leg has no shaping. You may want to consider using a larger size needle for the cast-on and cuff, then going down a needle size as you approach the ankle.  
* Although the front and back of the leg seem identical they do differ in the final four rounds.
* Be careful not to miss the two M1 increases in the first round of the instep as they can be difficult to see, particularly if you use the small chart.
* [Julie][1], one of the wonderful Sock Madness mods very generously created videos of the [cast-on][2] and [braid][3]. If you're having trouble with either of those techniques go check out her videos.

**Indomitable** adjective *impossible to subdue or defeat*

<hr><hr><hr>

It had been a shockingly, *shockingly* long time since I knit a pair of socks.  It really was shameful.  Something had to be done.  But I found I needed something especially tempting to bring me back to socks. These were just the thing!

The texture on the cuff is amazing.  It's tremendously fun to knit and always makes a beautiful fabric.  (And don't worry it's easier than it looks, and I've included step-by-step illustrations to show you exactly how to do it.)  Once the fancy bit at the cuff is done, the rest of the sock is just tidy ribbing, so it zips along at record speed.  

And then, when you're done and ready to wear them, you have one last decision to make.  You can either wear them just like you've knit them, or you can turn them inside out and fold down the cuff!  Both are delightful and I suspect you may find yourself alternating between them!  

<hr><hr><hr>

They're written in four sizes (56, 64, 72, and 80 stitch cast on) to fit most anyone.  And of course you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the sock. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a sturdy sock fabric with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 7, 8, or 9 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for the size you need. With that range of sizes and gauges, the socks will fit a foot (measured around the ball of the foot) between 6.75 and 12.5 inches (with lots of points in between).

The socks do use a bit more yarn than you might expect (the lovely cuff pattern takes extra yarn).  I needed about 50 yards more than I normally do for socks.  So if you usually use nearly all a skein of yarn, you might want to either look for an oversized skein, have an extra skein on hand, or plan for contrast toes.  

<hr><hr><hr>

**These are perfect for you if:**
* A reversible/cuffed sock sounds like just the thing
* You're as taken with that amazing cuff as I am
 
**They’re** ***not*** **for you if:**
* You don't like charts (the pattern uses charts)
* You hate swatching (you need to swatch to check your needle size)

As long as you’re getting the gauge listed for one, you should be fine with either.  I highly recommend finding a yarn with a percentage of nylon content to help these wear for longer, but a superwash wool is great too.  I added a small color work section to add enough interest to get halfway through these socks without noticing it, but feel free to knit them without!  If like me, double-pointed needles make you run for the hills, I highly suggest investing in a pair of 9” circular needles (I love ChiaoGoo the best), which is what this recipe is written for.

NEEDLES: US Size 5 (3.75 mm) needles: DPNs, 9"" circular, or long circular for Magic Loop, depending on your preference.

Notes From the Designer:

•Want to try your hand at socks without those tiny needles? These socks are worked on a larger needle with heavier weight yarn, so they knit up fast with fewer stitches. You can knock out your first sock over a couple of nights of TV knitting!
•This pattern is worked in the round from the cuff down to the toe, with a heel flap and gusset. A simple texture pattern breaks up the monotony of Stockinette stitch and adds a focal point to the front and back of the sock.
•Pattern is needle-agnostic, so you can use your preferred method of sock knitting: DPNs, 9"" circular, 2 circulars, or a long circular for Magic Loop. Use whichever method makes you comfortable!
•I was always the square peg trying to fit in a round hole. At least, until I grew comfortable enough with myself to do things my own way. I realized that there are a lot of us out there trying to make our own paths instead of following standard conventions. This pattern is for all the square pegs out there; keep doing your own thing! Create your own conventions, forge your own path, and don't be afraid to wear your heart on your sleeve (or your square on your socks)!

*“My mum always said things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect.”– Luna Lovegood, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*

Luna Lovegood may come across as dreamy or absent-minded, but she is able to view the world in a way that nobody else does. Luna offers a unique perspective, and her kind-hearted demeneanor is never judgemental. She believes in Harry at a time when few others do, and offers her unconditional support during some of the most difficult times in Harry’s life.

>There are only ten minutes in the life of a pear when it is perfect to eat. --Ralph Waldo Emerson

I love brights! Colorful yarns make my heart happy. When I saw bright colored tweed yarn at the New York Sheep and Wool festival several years ago I was enchanted. I knew I wanted to design socks with easy to knit textured patterns right away.  This collection came out of my desire to knit fun and beginner friendly socks in multiple variations.

Pattern notes: Written for both DK and Fingering weight yarns, this collection includes ‘top-down’ socks cast on at the cuff, then worked in the round on double pointed or circular needles to the heel. The Dutch heel is worked back and forth in rows, and then the heel is turned. Stitches are picked up along the heel flap, the work is joined in the round and the gusset stitches decreased. Each sock in this collection is embellished with an optional pear-shaped button, bead or charm. 

Adult small sample socks were knit in Suburban Stitcher Tweed DK (85% merino wool, 15% nylon; 231 yds/211m/100g per skein) in colorway: Gold weighing 92 grams using 212 yds/194m.

ERRATA: There is a mistake in stitch count after the heel turn, on page 4, Next Row. It has been corrected. (This should not have affected your ability to knit the sock.) 12/28/21

These socks are knitted with fingering weight yarn held double, which gives you a unique marled effect. Marled knitting is one of the most simple ways of color knitting. Holding two yarn strands of different colors together you will create a beautifully textured fabric of random colorful patterns.

This pattern is also great for knitting scrappy socks with leftover yarn or using mini skeins from yarn advent calendars.

The sock starts at the cuff, then you knit straight through the leg and the foot. After completing the toe, you will create a cut-in afterthought heel.

I love when the leaves change - when the temperature changes (here in Virginia, it is the noticeable lack of humidity that makes me happy) - when the bustle of summer and the new school year seems to give way to routine. I love it all!

Another thing I love? Sock sets! A full skein with a mini - sign me up! But I had a thought. What can I do with a mini other than the traditional heels-toes-cuffs??

The sock features a dramatic side motif, which combines a traditional Bavarian Twisted Knitting stitch pattern called “Spinning Woman” with a simpler cable. A simple yarn over cable rib cascades down the leg and the foot. Optional beads add a touch of glamor.

One skein will easily work for the small and medium. For a large, you will probably run a little short (just a little!) so plan to use either a second skein, a miniskein, or leftovers for the toe.

I do realize that turning a heel and knitting a gusset aren’t the worst things in the world, (in fact, some knitters really enjoy that step,) but I’ve always dreaded it and it was the one thing that prevented me from knitting all the socks. 

CHOOSING YOUR SOCK SIZE:	
It’s very important to have negative ease and a snug fitting sock when knitting The Magic Heel Socks. One tip is to knit the main body of your sock in the needle size stated in the pattern and then knit the heel section in a needle that is one size smaller.
*If you want to get really accurate, measure your foot circumference around the ball of your foot (the padded area just under your toes) and measure the area around your heel and ankle (round to the nearest ¼”/.5 cm). Use the larger of these 2 numbers and multiply by .95 – this should be the finished circumference of your socks.

What exactly are the BENEFITS of knitting Magic Heel Socks? 
I’m so glad you asked!
1. No finicky heel means these socks are a complete joy to knit, especially for beginner or nervous sock knitters!
2. Knit cuff-down, (but easily adjustable to be knit toe-up). 
3. They’re ideal if you’re using self-striping yarn because your stripes will be uninterrupted. 
4. They’re perfect for fast-growing children’s feet because they’re quick to knit and the heel can accommodate multiple sizes. 
5. They make the best gift knits, especially when you’re not exactly sure what size feet your recipient has. The perfect way to keep them a surprise!
6. When your socks finally wear out, you can easily mend them by cutting your sock, (just above or below the worn area) picking up the live stitches and then re-knitting your sock down or up. You’ll get twice as much wear out of your Magic Heel socks this way.

The quilted pattern is also simple to work and easy to memorize, with every other row being plain knitting.

**UPDATE 10/23/2011:** Pattern revised to include easier-to-read charts.

I thought of this pattern as soon as I cast off for my Katie Socks. I had been trying to figure out what to do with this yarn because it was so soft and pretty and needed some twisted stitches, and then I thought of this. An evening of playing around with some scrap sock yarn and I figured out how to make the ribs work in this. Here is the result. It's a top-down sock with a garter cuff (that waves a bit with the stitch pattern - which I like). There is no cabling involved, simply twisted rib, increases, and decreases. The pattern is charted and while it may look a bit daunting at first, it really is easy to remember.

It appears some errors crept into the pattern during the publication process.  I'm sorry for this.

**First**, the RS and WS labels are reversed in the short-row heel shaping instructions.  The last short-row decrease is worked on a wrong side row and when you complete the wrap & turn, the right side is facing you.  The same is true for the short-row increases.  The last increase is worked on the wrong side and when it is complete, the right side of the sock is facing you.

**Second**, the instructions for redistributing the sts after the short rows are completed and picking up the sts for the heel flap are also incorrect as they were published.  Below are the original instructions that I sent.  You should follow these instead of the instructions in the book:

Knit the next 10 heel sts onto the right needle. There are now 11 sts on the right needle (Needle #4) and 10 sts on the left needle (Needle #1).  Remove the 19 instep sts from the waste yarn and divide them onto two dpns (Needle #2 and Needle #3).  You will now knit in the round again.  The beginning of the rnd is at the center back of the sock.  

Gusset
Knit the 10 sts from Needle #1.  Using Needle #1, pick up and knit 3 sts along the side of the heel flap.  Work the sts on Needle #2 and Needle #3 in the established Rib & Garter Stitch, beginning with Rnd 10 (when you work Rnd 1 of the Leg, see below,  Needle #2 will begin with a purl stitch).   Pick up and knit 3 sts along the other side of the heel flap.  Knit the 11 sts from Needle #4.

The afterthought heel is quick and painless to knit and smooth and comfy to wear. You simply knit in some waste yarn to hold the place for your heel, then continue working the rest of the sock as a tube. Afterwards, pick out the waste yarn and you're ready to knit your heel with simple paired decreases on both sides of your new hole. You'll avoid the gaps on either side of the waste yarn row by lifting up a stitch on either side of each row and working it together with its neighbor (think of it as a simultaneous pickup and decrease).",,223,598,4.39,"S/M, L",Worsted

* Note on gauge - If you prefer a firmer sock fabric, use a heavier weight sock yarn such as Dream in Color Smooshy, or go down a needle size and knit the large.

* Note on sizing - the large fits a women's US 9-11 shoe size, and works for wide feet. If you have wide calves, don't go down a needle size for the ribbing on the cuff.

* Note on instep - the stitch count for needles 2 and 3 will vary as the flames increase and decrease. Sometimes there will be more sts on needle 2, sometimes more on needle 3. Don’t worry about it, because the total sts for needles 2 and 3 stays the same.

As the name might suggest, the road was lined on both sides with towering black walnut trees. We didn't live in that house for very long, but our time there was happy and I think back on those tall, beautiful trees with fondness.

The Walnut Street Socks were inspired by those trees. They feature panels of seed stitch that are reminiscent of the walnuts dropped from the branches, and swaths of stockinette along the front and back leg echo the street that they lined. The pattern is written cuff down with an eye-of-partridge heel flap and gusset, but the design is easily modified to be knit toe up.

Every year on March 21, people all over the world gather to celebrate World Down Syndrome day. The ‘Lots of Socks’ initiative was started as a fun way to help create support and awareness all over the world, encouraging people to wear brightly colored and unique socks. Why socks? Because socks look like chromosomes and people with Down Syndrome have an extra chromosome. These socks are intended to get sock knitters involved with a great cause. Using only one color at a time, slipped stitches create a checkerboard effect down the leg of the sock. By pairing a self-striping yarn with a solid, there are only two yarns needed. Brightly colored and unique, this design will be appropriate for sock knitters of all skill levels and create attention for a very worthy cause.

*Inch by inch, row by row
Gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe
And a piece of fertile ground. ” 
– Garden Song, by David Mallett* 

Garden Song is a lace sock that turns a single color of yarn into a flourishing feat of footwear! Beginning at the toe, these socks use lace increases and twisted rib ‘inch by inch’ to create thriving blossoms up the middle of the sock. Beaded rib is worked along the sides of the main lace panel, creating clean lines that lengthen the foot and leg. Gusset increases allow for a comfortable fit and the turned heel creates triangular lines along the back of the leg. Three different ribbing lengths allow you to create ‘inch by inch’ the finishing touch you need. For an enjoyable knit of radiating beauty, you’ll want to be singing your own Garden Song!

**Sizes**
XS,S(M,L,XL); sizes roughly correspond to a plain stockinette sock with 48,54(60,66,72) stitches.

*Circumferences on 2.5 mm needles with average to heavy fingering yarn:*
* XS - foot 7 inches/18 cm; ankle 7.5 inches/19 cm
* S - foot 7.5 inches/19 cm; ankle 8 inches/20 cm
* M - foot 8 inches/20 cm; ankle 8.5 inches/21.5 cm
* L - foot 8.5 inches/21.5 cm; ankle 9 inches/23 cm
* XL - foot 9 inches/23 cm; ankle 9.5 inches/24 cm

*For 2.25 mm needles and light to average fingering yarn, subtract .5 inches/1.5 cm from the above measurements.*

**Yarn Requirements**
Fingering weight, 300,325(375,400,450) yards / 275,300(350,375,425) meters. 

**Overview**
Two mirrored modular socks are worked with join-as-you go swirly units—no seaming or grafting. The toe and cuff are knit up from the foot and leg units.

The units are something of a puzzle to put together. A diagram that you can cut out and assemble is provided to guide the sock construction. Both written instructions and charts are included.

Units begin from a speedy provisional cast-on onto waste yarn (a built-in lifeline!) combined with knitting up from neighboring units. You won’t lose time getting each unit started, but there will be a few more ends than usual to weave in. Choose textured star units or plain smooth units, placed where guided by the diagram or as you like.

**Before you begin**
Regular sock construction doesn’t really apply, but it helps to have familiarity with working sock toes and using small needles. You should also be comfortable knitting in the round, increasing, decreasing, and working a provisional cast-on. I like to work these on double-points, but circulars can work too.

1079397,Soft Morning Socks,Bloom & Create // Emma Janet,2.14,32.0,4.0,Stockinette in the round,400.0,"***Why Soft Mornings?*** 
Because they have been my saving grace through quarantine. There is something so special to me to have a soft, gentle morning routine. 
Soft morning routines need not be complicated, in fact they are all about slowness, and flexibility, within the context of routine. My soft morning routine: alarm goes off around 7am, I roll around a little bit, then write my morning pages (shout out to the Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron). After I go make coffee, and I grab my knitting. I play NPR’s Up First and get my knitting in!
I imagine these sock being knit on soft mornings. Or maybe, worn during them. I hope you enjoy these socks - and they help you take off the training wheels when it comes to colorwork sock knitting. 

***Construction***
This pattern provides TWO different construction options. Knitters can opt to create these socks *cuff down, or toe up.* I offer these two techniques to give new colorwork sock knitters the option to do the first set of colorwork as the foot colorwork. Colorwork on the cuff of a sock, while stunning, is trickier as it needs to stretch over the heel of the foot (typically the widest part of the sock). If you opt for the toe up construction, you can 'practice' colorwork on the foot, and then perhaps have an easier time with the leg colorwork. 

The pink socks are toe up and the blue socks are cuff down. 

Both construction methods feature the same simple colowork motif.

This sock is the first in the series designed for sock sets with a main skein + *two* mini skeins. These socks were inspired by the Long Dog Yarn ""Hades"" sock set and Greek key patterns.

These toe-up socks feature a unique gently angled toe, shaped for right and left feet, and have a smooth hybrid mini-gusset/short-row heel. The patterning is achieved with stranded knitting. There is one round per motif that uses three strands in the round, for a total of 3 rounds per sock using three strands, but all other stranded rounds use only two per round.

Growing up my dad would always talk about the lines of buildings and I never understood why he found them so fascinating. I mean, they are just buildings…right? All these years later, I now find myself looking closely at the lines of buildings, taking note of the flow, the curves, angles and different styles.

Recently, I found myself looking through photos of Medieval cathedrals. Every detail is methodically thought out to ensure not just function but beauty as well. The arching lines that create breathtaking ceilings are called Clerestory, and it is these beautiful lines that were the inspiration behind these socks.

Step into these cable-filled ***Clerestory*** socks, inspired by the world of architecture, and discover the beauty of lines around us.

Fun to knit and even more fun to wear, these socks will quickly become a winter favorite.

Winter’s Gift is knit from the toe up in the round. Beginning with the lighter main color, slip-stitch patterning is worked across the top of foot and up the ankle. Mini gussets are added before and after the short-row heels to give a more generous heel allowance. Above the ankle, the slip-stitch pattern extends around the entire leg before changing to a wide band of two-color stranded colorwork.



**Errata:** 

The Snowdrift Stitch pattern is written differently across the top of the foot versus when it extends all the way around the leg:

Foot length is fully adjustable within the pattern. Finished sock measures 0.25 in / 0.5 cm less than actual foot length to ensure a good fit.

Size Notes: This is a less stretchy stitch pattern, so if in doubt, err on the side of a larger size.

NEEDLES AND NOTIONS
1 set US 3 (3.25mm) double-pointed needles or needles suitable for your preferred method of small-circumference knitting (long circulars for Magic Loop, 2 circulars, etc), or size needed to match gauge, stitch markers, scissors, tapestry needle

GAUGE

35 sts and 42 rounds in 4in / 10 cm of Welted Lace pattern in the round, after washing and blocking (see page X)

PATTERN NOTES 
These socks are cast on at the toe the Turkish Cast On, then increases are worked to reach the required foot circumference. The foot is worked in a lace and garter stitch pattern on the instep and stockinette stitch on the sole, before adding a short row heel. The lace and garter pattern continues up the front and back of the leg, leading into a garter stitch cuff. The stitches are cast off using a stretchy method.

**Yarn**
Four skeins of Lattes & Llamas [Vacation Yarn][2] (100 grams/ 463 yards) or a comparable fingering weight yarn in four contrasting colorways.

Sample is shown in ‘Archdruid’ as Color A, ‘Baskerville’ as Color B, ‘My Warlock Girlfriend’ as Color C, and ‘Stars Hollow’ as Color D. 

Color A: 26 (29, 32) g – 120 (134, 148) yds / 110 (123, 135) m
Color B: 6 (7, 8) g – 28 (33, 37) yds / 25 (30, 34) m
Color C: 16 (18, 20) g – 74 (83, 93) yds / 68 (76, 85) m
Color D: 35 (39, 43) g – 162 (181, 199) yds / 148 (165, 182) m

When choosing your yarn, make sure Color A contrasts strongly with Color D while Color B contrasts strongly with Color C. I recommend taking a photograph of the yarns together, and then changing it into black and white to see if the colors contrast strongly enough.

**Needles**
US 1.5 / 2.5 mm 40” circular needles or size needed to obtain gauge for the cuff, heel, foot, and toe of the sock.

US2 / 2.75 mm 40” circular needles or size needed to obtain gauge for the colorwork around the leg and before the toe of the sock.

40” circular needles are used to work in magic loop, which is my preferred method of knitting socks. However, they can be worked on DPNs or 2 circular needles if preferred.

**Gauge**
32 sts and 40 rnds = 4” / 10 cm in stranded colorwork, knit in the round with US 2 / 2.75 mm needles and blocked.

Sometimes, people screw up, and they screw up badly. That’s not terribly interesting in and of itself, but when someone who’s screwed up badly gets a chance to make things right? Oh, that’s the stuff of legends.

I love a second chance romance, where people who once loved each other get another chance to try again and do better. In fact, these socks are a second chance romance, of sorts.

You see, this sock pattern was originally set to be published with a company that has since gone out of business. The pattern was never published, but in a truly lucky turn of events, I managed to get back both the rights to the pattern and the original sample. This pattern and I get a chance to try again together.

These socks are knit from the cuff down and graded to five sizes. They feature delicately intertwined cables and lots of ribbing to keep them snug and cozy. A heel flap and gusset provide an adjustable fit, while the socks are finished with a classic wedge toe.

ABOUT:
Greetings from the Woods of New Hampshire!

I’m on a mission to fill every sock drawer in the world with beautiful, hand-knit socks!! I felt the only way to achieve this mission was to design socks so that EVERYONE could feel successful at knitting. 

I realize that turning a heel and knitting a gusset aren’t the worst things in the world, (in fact, some knitters enjoy that step,) but I’ve always dreaded it and it was the one thing that prevented me from knitting all the socks. 

CHOOSING YOUR SOCK SIZE:	
It’s essential to have negative ease and a snug-fitting sock when knitting The Magic Heel Socks. One tip is to knit the main body of your sock in the needle size stated in the pattern and then knit the heel section in a needle that is one size smaller.
*If you want to get accurate, measure your foot circumference around the ball of your foot (the padded area just under your toes) and measure the area around your heel 
and ankle (round to the nearest ¼”/.5 cm). Use the larger of these 2 numbers and multiply by .95 – this should be the finished circumference of your socks.

What exactly are the BENEFITS of knitting Magic Heel Socks? 

I’m so glad you asked!

1. No finicky heel means these socks are a complete joy to knit, especially for beginner or nervous sock knitters!
2. Knit cuff-down, (but easily adjustable to be knit toe-up). 
3. They’re ideal for self-striping yarn because your stripes will be uninterrupted. 
4. They’re perfect for fast-growing children’s feet because they’re quick to knit and the heel can accommodate multiple sizes. 
5. They make the best gift knits, especially when you’re not exactly sure what size feet your recipient has. The perfect way to keep them a surprise!
6. When your socks finally wear out, you can easily mend them by cutting your sock, (just above or below the worn area) picking up the live stitches, and then re-knitting your sock down or up. You’ll get twice as much wear out of your Magic Heel socks this way.

<br />
<strong>Additional Yarn Information</strong> <br />

The pattern calls for one skein of yarn (357 yards)  in color #003 Natural, but notes that the sample socks took &quot;almost every inch of the yarn called for.&nbsp; If you need to make a longer foot, omit one repeat of the lace on the leg or have more yarn available.&quot;


<strong>From Pattern Introduction: </strong>Generally the mention of Latvian knitting reminds me of colorful mittens. These socks were inspired, not by color knitting but by a pair of lacy Latvian stockings, knit in Latvia&hellip;The lace is simple to work and very decorative. The leg is shaped by working four decreases on one round midway down the leg. The heel is turned with Half-Handkerchief Heel shaping and the socks end with a Star Toe. These socks are sized for ladies.<br />

Nice, thick socks to pad around the apartment, but also rugged socks for an adventurous spirit who goes on lengthy train trips and gets his shoes stolen. The solution comes in the form of a soft DK-weight sock yarn which I’ve dyed in what his mother assures me are his favorite colors, of plain design but sporting a linen stitch toe, sole, and heel for an extra thick and sturdy fabric that’s sure to last for many years of trekking across the exotic Orient.

This is a 64 st sock. The lace pattern is based on Stansfield 196 but mirrored to form Diamonds. Actually I started this design differently, but the diamonds weren't working out like I planned and when I adjusted, I realized how closely the lace chart was to the Stansfield one. 

I have again used the same toe-up heel as in Lacy Ripples and Emily's Socks that I worked out after trying Wendy Johnson's heel. But I didn't like the idea of adding or dropping stitches at heel time to use her heel so I worked out my own by drawing out what I did with a top-down 64 st sock and reversing the numbers. It's similar to her heel, but took me several days to work out the numbers for this one -- probably because I'm a bit slow. But my family did tease me for turning heels on napkins and bulletin covers as well as in my sleep.

> The socks are designed to go both ways. Knit them toe-up or topdown using the same stitch pattern. Knitting top-down will result in chevrons that point down towards the toe as shown, while knitting toe-up will result in chevrons that point up towards the cuff. This is also a stitch pattern that’s easily reversible, so if you’d like to work toe-up with downward-pointing chevrons (or top-down with upward-pointing chevrons), simply flip the charts over and work them upside-down. Ingenious!

This sock is a Christmas 2012 present for my son-in-law, Larry.

He asked for a Gansey, so I designed one around his plans for 2013. The wave pattern as a central motif signifies Larry’s pending trip for work (which will take him away from home for about 8 weeks). The “mini” waves signify a small trip. The moss ladders on either side are pathways that will take him away and bring him back home, again. The ribs are to hold him to our family while he is away.

It uses traditional Gansey stitches in a toe-up format.  It is sized for a Men's US size 12 medium shoe, but the width is very stretchy and can easily fit a women's wide foot to a men's wide foot.

In the second season, Ragnar Lothbrok’s son Bjorn has grown up into a fierce warrior trying to prove himself and earn his father’s respect.  At the same time, he is still devoted to his mother, Lagertha, and will do anything to protect her.

These unisex socks are based on the diamond pattern on Bjorn’s protective leather armor.  In keeping with the theme, I’ve knit mine in a gorgeous colorway reminiscent of the armor’s weathered look - Hazel Knits Artisan Sock in Sassafras.  The pattern is best shown off with a semi-solid, tonal or heathered colorway.

The real Bjorn Lothbrok (son of Ragnar, the legendary King of the Vikings) is known in history as Bjorn Ironside, one of the most prolific of the Viking raiders around the year 860 AD.

This 72-st pattern can be made smaller using a thinner fingering weight yarn with size 0 or 1 needles.  To make it larger, extra stitches can easily be added to the edges of the chart, or a heavier fingering or even a sport weight yarn may be used with size 1.5 or 2 needles.  Note that the cables pull the sock in a little, but not an extreme amount.

An after thought heel mimics the ordinary toe construction. The stranding is basic- only a few rows and only two colors at a time. This is an easy way to to learn about stranded color work.You can also use up some of those odd little leftover balls of sock yarn.

Thank you, Willow. The sock is top down as written. You can probably adapt it to toe up if you want, but it is important to keep the stitch count in the correct multiple for the stranded design on the leg. 
I wear a 6.5 or sometimes 7 shoe (US), and this sock fits me as written. I’d say this is an adult woman’s small in size. You can make it a medium by extending the striped part of the foot a few more rows. 
Unstretched measurements are: 
Heel to toe - 8.75” 
Arch sole to top of foot - 4” or 8” around 
Leg from bottom of heel to top of cuff- 7”

***Get this pattern in [Addicted to Sock Knitting, Issue 7 Summer 2016][1]*** featuring the pattern and an interview with the designer.

I love the look of lace but hate knitting holes into my socks. I love the look of cable motifs, but dislike all the purling. So I designed this stitch pattern to stamp an impression on the top of the foot, leaving behind an etched or impressed look. The results appear deceptively complicated, but are actually quite easily knit: with no purling, and just slipping and crossing stitches.

This pattern is toe-up and written for distinct left and right socks.The pattern includes the Spacious One-needle Mock Gusset heel, which does not disrupt the striping on the top of the foot. The heel closely mimics the traditional heel-flap and gusset heel, but is actually a short-row heel worked from the toe-up.

This pattern looks fabulous in tonal, variegated, and self-striping yarn. The large range of sizes means you can knit a pair for the whole family, and everyone will be thoroughly impressed!

The fun slipping, sliding, and twists and turns are the inspiration for these socks.

 The Slip Slide Splash socks are a fun way to combine 2 of your favorite colors or use up scraps that might not have enough yardage for a full pair of socks.  These socks feature a fun slipped st motif, and through switching colors every round you create water slides that race across your foot. The design also features a solid toe, heel and cuff in the MC to highlight the slide motif.

**SIZES:**
Child (Adult-XSmall, Adult-Small, Adult-Medium)(Adult-Large, Adult-XLarge)

**Leg Height:** 3.5 (6.5, 7, 7.5)(8, 8.5)"" [9 (16.5, 17.5, 19)(20, 21.5) cm]

**YARN:**
Fingering-weight sock yarn (approximately 400 yards per 100 grams) of 2 colors, with MC needing more yardage (60-70g for larger sizes).    

If you swap the MC and CC for the 2nd sock, you will use 50% of each color.

Most sizes can be knit with a 100g of fingering weight yarn. The largest sizes, especially if knit for long feet, may require additional yardage.

**YARN COLORS:**
* I recommend pairing a solid or tonal colorway with a highly contrasting variegated, tonal, self-striping, or gradient! 
* For highest contrast, pick 2 colorways with no matching colors.
* Swap the MC and CC on the 2nd sock as a fun way of mixing things up, and creating distinctly unique yet matching socks!

**HEEL:**  Spacious OMG heel

**SKILLS USED:** Increases, decreases, Judy’s Magic Cast-on, Alternating colors/switching yarns.

This top-down pattern is appropriate for sock beginners that have made a least one pair of vanilla socks and thus know knitting basics. However, I have included a lot of how-to details in sock construction that the intermediate or advanced knitter can easily skim over, especially if they make choices for an alternate cuff ribbing or heel type.

Her incredible talent for dyeing self-striping yarns inspired me to make a simple sock pattern with just the right amount of texture.* 

Malia’s original colorway, “**Romilda Vane’s Box of Chocolates**,” was inspired by the scene in the Harry Potter series where Ron is poisoned after seeking a cure to a love potion-tainted box of chocolates. Guess what saves poor Ron? {Besides Harry, of course.} A bezoar! A bezoar is a stone from the stomach of a goat and it’s a powerful antidote to common poisons. The teeny bobbles in the socks represent the stone {bezoars are actually a real thing!} that saves Ron’s life.

This pattern DOES NOT COME WITH HEEL INSTRUCTIONS. It is designed to work best with the Fish Lips Kiss Heel (or similar short row heel) or an afterthought heel. If you have a few pairs of socks under your belt, you’ll have no trouble subbing in your favorite heel!

These funky zebra print socks are knit cuff down with an afterthought heel, making it easier to concentrate on the stranded colorwork pattern without worrying about shaping the heel.

The stranded zebra pattern is a simple 8-stitch repeat and is provided in chart form. It is even simple enough for colorwork beginners! The pattern is written for ankle-length socks, but the leg can easily be lengthened by adding repeats of the zebra pattern.

I find all sorts of treasures washed up on the shore (I firmly maintain that they are treasures, and you won’t convince me otherwise). One of my very favorite things to find is bits of old rope tied in marvelously complicated knots. The edges are frayed, and years of water and wind have rendered them hopelessly stuck, but somehow that just makes them all the more beautiful. These delightfully chunky cables remind me of those glorious knots with all their twists and turns.

Don’t let the charts scare you. This is, at its heart, just two-by-two ribbing. There are only two cable stitches to master, and you only work them a tiny handful of times.

I completely lost my knitting inspiration when Covid-19 hit the globe, continued with injustice towards black and brown people...but I wanted to honor my friend, her partner, and their journey, even with much delay. Sometimes I feel hopeless with so much ugliness in the world but realize that Dawn will always come no matter how hard and ugly life seems to be. I hope these socks will be a reminder for us to never lose hope, even through ups and downs, because Dawn is almost here.

*This pattern has been professionally tech edited and test knit by a pool of at least ten testers.*

There are few treats I’ve never been tempted to make for myself at home, but one of them is the elusive crème brûlée. Something about the finicky nature of custard, the little ramekins, and the involvement of a blow torch makes me just a little bit nervous, so I’ve decided to leave this one to the professionals.

But whenever I’m at a restaurant with crème brulee on the menu, well, you know what I’m ordering for dessert.

The warm, golden color and the texture of these socks reminded me of the perfect crispy crust on a crème brûlée. You’ll find that, unlike my favorite scorched treat, these socks aren’t fiddly at all, but instead have a simple four-row pattern repeat that looks much harder than it really is. Both the socks and the dessert, though, are highly satisfying.

>Six days shalt thou paddle and pack, but on the seventh thou shalt wash thy socks. ~ Aldo Leopold, considered to be the father of wildlife ecology

This lovely blue tweed needed to be a part of this sock collection, not only is it my mom’s favorite color (I grew up with a blue living room carpet, curtains, couch, chairs, all of it baby blue), but also because it just shines. 

Dianne Brown of Suburban Stitcher yarns does lovely tweeds, and this is so reminiscent of the sky that a lovely pear tree would grow under to ripen it’s fruit, it just seemed too perfect. 

PATTERN NOTES
Written for both DK and Fingering weight yarns, this collection includes ‘top-down’ socks, cast on at the cuff, then worked in the round on double pointed or circular needles to the heel. 
The Dutch heel flap is worked back and forth in rows, and then the heel is turned. Stitches are picked up along the heel flap, and the work is joined in the round and the gusset stitches decreased. 
Each sock in this collection is embellished with an optional pear-shaped button, bead, or charm. 

NOTIONS:  Locking ring or removable stitch marker, tapestry needle, optional: 8 mm decorative  beads (6)
8 mm Pearl beads – JoAnn Fabrics / Michaels

ERRATA: There is a mistake in stitch count after the heel turn, on page 4, Next Row. It has been corrected. (This should not have affected your ability to knit the sock.) 12/28/21

Unlike the prior projects in 2022, for this final pair of socks we're going to release each sock as a full pattern (rather than leg one week and foot the week after). The pattern for sock 1 will release on October 23 and the pattern for the second sock will drop on November 6. 

To get automatic clue updates add this pattern to your library, and when new clue releases you should get a library notification when the download is ready. And don’t forget to join us over in the Geek-A-Long forum to hang out with other awesome fibermancers!

You can easily substitute the heel with your favorite heel, while continuing to use the gusset/bottom of foot chart to knit the pattern on the sole, as the pattern does not run into the gusset area.  

Both the heel and toe can be started after either a full or half pattern repeat.

The main pattern file has larger charts that should be easy to read.

A second file with condensed charts is included.  In this file, the Main Chart and Back of Leg Charts are together on one page for each size, for those who find it easier to have them on the same page.  However, to do this, those charts are smaller than I would have liked.

The Ya Filthy Animal Socks are worked in the round from the cuff down with stranded knitting. The leg pattern begins off-centered on the front of the leg with decreases worked into the chart. After working a short row heel, you will continue to work off-center down the foot. This sock pattern is recommended for knitters who have experience with stranded colorwork, knitting in the round, and reading charts.

**Needles**
US 1.5 / 2.5 mm 40” circular needles for the cuff, heel, and toe of the sock.
US2 / 2.75 mm 40” circular needles for the leg and foot of the sock.

40” circular needles are used to work in magic loop, which is my preferred method of knitting socks. However, they can be worked on DPNs or 2 circular needles if preferred.

As with many colorwork socks, these were designed with little to no ease. Choose the size closest to your actual foot measurement.

I designed these socks for a basic need, to keep my feet warm in these cold Montana winters. They serve that purpose very well. A word of caution, if you have hardwood floors, be careful if you knit with mohair, the socks become extra slippery. If you have kids or grandkids, they will love that aspect, my kids love to ‘skate’ on the floors with hand knit socks.

This is a ribbed sock with a German Short Row Heel. This type of short row heel adds a bit more depth than a typical short row heel, so if you have a higher instep, these socks may fit you better. 

The pattern is written for magic loop. Needle 1 will be the top of the foot and front of the leg. Needle 2 will be the bottom of the foot, heel, and back of the leg. You have the option of knitting this sock toe-up (pgs. 3 & 4) or top-down (pgs. 5 & 6), both directions are included in this pattern.

This is a great go-to sock that will fit everyone from kids to adults. You can knit these with fingering weight sock yarn and mohair held double for a pair of super warm and fuzzy socks, or knit it with a single strand of DK weight yarn. 

Sizes: 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = 36 (40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60) sts around.

Actual sock circumference: 6 (6.6, 7.3, 8, 8.6, 9.3, 10)”

To Fit: approximately  7 (7.6, 8.3, 9, 9.6, 10.3, 11)” around ball of foot. You want your sock to have about 10% negative ease around and 10% negative ease for length. *(Unless you are using non-superwash wool, like in the toe-up sample, you want your foot to have little to no ease in length, due to felting.)

This year I want to place my anger on a pedestal and celebrate it because right now it’s my fandom.

***I want to wrap myself in a cape woven from thread spun from the tears of my enemies; its staple drawn long and smooth and sharp in an inferno of my burning rage.***

The Burn It Down Socks are coming to you just in time for some Pride knitting, and you can read more about the theme on the [Lattes & Llamas blog.][2]

**Yarn**
1 Lattes & Llamas [Burn It Down Sock Kit][8] or a comparable sock weight yarn in five colorways. 

Kit contains 50g each “Baskerville” (Color A) and “Stars Hollow” (Color B); 20g each Marigold (Color E), Hep Alien (Color D), and Garnet (Color C) on Lattes & Llamas Vacation Yarn (75% Superwash Merino, 25% Nylon; 463yds / 423m – 100g).

***Yarn required for socks + functional swatch:***
Color A: 112(125, 140, 154) yds / 102(115, 128, 140)m - 24(27, 30, 33) g
Color B: 140(150, 162, 185) yds / 128(136, 148, 170)m - 30(32, 35, 40) g

Color E: 48(52, 56, 60) yds / 43(47, 51, 55)m - 10(11, 12, 13) g

Note that yardage is estimated, includes the yardage required for knitting the swatch, and may vary depending on yarn used, gauge variations, or modifications. 

When choosing your yarn, make sure Color A contrasts strongly with Color B. We recommend taking a photograph of the yarns together and then filtering it to black and white to see if they contrast strongly enough.

**Needles**
US 1.0 / 2.25 mm and US 2 / 2.75 mm 40” circular needles to work in Magic Loop or size needed to obtain gauge.

We prefer the Magic Loop method when knitting socks. If you are more comfortable using DPNs or two circulars, this pattern is easily converted.

**Notions**
2 Stitch Markers; Tapestry Needle; Tape Measure; 2 colors of waste yarn for holding sts: 2 pieces of waste yarn A (approx.. 10” each – longer is fine but not shorter), and 1 piece of waste yarn B (approx. 16” or enough to knit 45 sts). 

**Gauge**
36 sts and 44 rows = 4” / 10 cm in stranded colorwork, knit in the round with larger sized needles and blocked. See gauge swatch directions on page 4.

**Sizing**
Size 1(2, 3, 4) has a 7.5 (8.5, 10, 11)” / 19 (22, 25.5, 28) cm foot circumference, unstretched.
Leg length from to Cuff to Start of Heel: 5.5” / 14 cm

Foot Length: Adjustable

As with many colorwork socks, these were designed with little to no ease. Choose the size closest to your actual foot measurement. Stitch counts are written for size 1 with (2, 3, 4) size stitch counts in brackets.

Inspired by Joni Mitchell’s song “Chelsea Morning,” these socks are designed to evoke sunny 1970s vibes. This pattern actually includes two designs! You can choose a striped ribbed version with a simple lace cuff or a stranded colorwork version with a cabled lace cuff.

The ’70s Folk Socks are knit from the cuff down and come in two variations: a ribbed version with rainbow stripes and a stranded colorwork version with a geometric design reminiscent of beaded curtains. Both versions share the same stitch count, mock short-row heel, and toe. They also feature a variation on the same cuff—the ribbed socks have a simple lace ribbing, while the colorwork socks use a more intricate twisted stitch and cabled ribbing combined with the same lace.

**NEEDLES**
US 1 / 2.25mm knitting needles suitable for working small circumferences in the round. Always use a needle size that will result in the correct gauge after blocking.

Ribbed socks are wonderful.  They both stretch and hug the foot, which makes them an ideal choice not only for yourself, but when knitting for someone else as well.  That’s why this pattern includes six sizes: from a child’s small, to an adult extra large.

However, while ribbed socks are wonderful for their fit, sometimes it feels like the knitting process is long.  These socks have short sections of rib that fall down in a waterfall pattern, which not only look lovely, but knitting the pattern repeat makes it easy to see your progress.  Plus you are likely to have it memorized by the end of the first sock, which makes the second sock go that much faster!

I have to give credit to a previous tester here - they requested a pattern similar to this based on an idea from one of my other patterns.  While I am not sure this pattern is exactly what they had in mind, this is what I came up with, and I quite like it.

The ribbing pattern on this sock is on the front, while the back of the sock is stockinette.

These patterns are meant for times when you want a mostly mindless knitting project you can pick up and put down easily, but also want something a little more interesting than a plain vanilla sock - hence, the ""Vanilla Sundae"" name. All 6 patterns are also available together in an ebook for the best total price! The ebook also comes with a **BONUS 15-page Vanilla Sock Recipe** written for both cuff-down and toe up constructions, an expanded 12 sizes, guidance on how to adjust sizing for your own stitch and round gauge, as well as plenty of other tips so that you can create handknit socks you will actually wear! I hope you enjoy these sock patterns, and happy knitting!

The color and speckles of this yarn and ridges from the texture made me think of moose tracks ice cream! These socks feature a garter stitch rib pattern, and will work great when worked up with speckled, lightly variegated, or tonal yarn! Three children sizes and four adult sizes are included.

**Construction**
These socks are knit cuff-down, starting with a 2x2 rib. A single garter ridge is worked after the cuff, followed by the main garter stitch rib pattern for the remainder of the leg and extending into the heel flap. After the heel is turned, the rib pattern is worked on the top of the foot only, ending in another single garter ridge. Toe decreases are then worked and the toe stitches are grafted together.

The heel flap split lines up with the ribbing, and the gusset stitches are picked up and purled in order to create a ridge that further enhances the ribbing lines (video tutorial included on how to pick up and purl stitches, along with a tip of a new-to-me method to avoid those pesky holes in the corner gaps!).

The Fruit Loop Socks have an easy to knit stitch pattern in a striping pattern that gives the socks a whimsical look. 
The easy to execute textured pattern is made of simple knits and purls. Use two mini skeins along with the main skein of fingering weight yarn to create stripes, or make scrappy stripes with a variety of colored yarns.
The beautiful green and purple sock set is ""Darcy's Delight"" by Bella Fio Yarns.

<p><em><font size=""-1"" face=""Verdana, Trebuchet MS, Arial"" color=""#333333"">This                              design uses a simple textured stitch that enhances                              the glorious colors in Koigu. I chose a very                              bright colorway because this stitch pattern                              becomes lost in the darker ones. If you don't                              use the suggested color, go bright! Every stitch                              in this colorway reminded me of spring as I                              knit the socks in the dead of winter: tulip                              pink, crocus purple, azalea red, daffodil yellow,                              new-tree green.</font></em></p>

The 4-round repeat makes it quick to learn.                              Knit the socks quite firmly. Two skeins are                              definitely enough to make the smaller size;                              if you alter the length of the leg, you'll need                              to buy one more skein, most likely.</font></em></p>",,521,743,3.9,,Fingering

Want to get retro with your needles, but feel legwarmers are a little too Flashdance? Need a little jailbait striping in your life, but not the record? Just want the neatest 2D feet this side of the century? These may just be the socks for you...or someone you love.

> Each sock has a different chart for its cuff and plenty of possibility. Work them as written, or mirror one chart for an alternate universe pair. Use a variegated yarn when knitting the grimmees for a stained glass effect. Raid your leftovers for a rainbow look. Change the positioning of the repeating invaders on each sock. Substitute purls for stranded knitting for a very subtle impression. There are plenty of choices and ways to make these socks yours, including a number chart to immortalize your own high score.

This sock design displays those features including the split in the welt. The gusset for the heel is worked like an underarm gusset, then turned with a short-row technique. This allows ample ease for heel shaping. An enterprising knitter may even choose to include initials in the plain area.

It includes a simple method for changing colors and carrying the color not in use, incorporating a decorative seam stitch which can be used to place increases or decreases to shape the sock.

You can easily make two-color socks by changing colors after the gusset decreases, or try making contrast toes, heels, and cuffs. 

Working socks from the toe-up means that you can customize the size as you go. This pattern provides sizing based on Craft Yarn Council’s sizing guide for infants and children, but each child is unique. You can lengthen the foot or heel flap to create a custom fit. If you are unsure which size to make, choose the circumference of the sock that most closely matches the foot of the child, and lengthen the foot as necessary. Remember, gauge is crucial for a good fit. 

If you are able to measure the foot of the intended child, it is best to measure the foot circumference, length from toe to ankle, and length from toe to end of heel to choose the size that best fits the child’s measurements and customize as necessary.

The pattern also works well with self-striping colorways, especially when they are combined with one or two complementary colors.

The chevron design flows through this sock from the garter-stitch cuff to the toe.  The patterning is echoed in the slip-stitch heel flap in the Cuff-down version.  The toe-up version includes instructions for a short-row ""Boomerang"" heel that avoids the p3tog's of a standard short-row heel. 

The pattern includes both versions for one price. Either way, toe up or cuff down, it makes a beautiful sock from leftovers.

Regarding the files: There are 3 files, one for each of the versions and a landscape version of the chart for the smaller size of the cuff-down version.  It is not necessary to download this landscape chart, since it is included in the pattern in portrait-style.  The chart pdf produces a slightly larger print for those that prefer larger type. The toe-up pattern is marked with an i, for interim, and will be updated as needed when all testers have finished. 

I am indebted to Amy Jones for her most helpful technical editing.  Amy also created the charts from my spreadsheets.

I discovered that those scenes are filmed at Powerscourt Waterfall, which is Ireland’s highest waterfall.  These socks are inspired by the falls, with the lace panel cascading down the side of each leg like the water, flanked by small cables that remind me of the little streams branching off on either side of the falls.  Because the panels are on the outside of each leg, there are instructions for both right and left socks. 

Two sizes are given, but the pattern circumference is adjustable by adding/subtracting from the stockinette portion on either side of the lace panels.  The leg length is flexible and can be worked to the knitter's preference.

Curiosity cabinets were collections of wonderful objects brought together to inspire, delight, and inform.

Presented here, in this third volume of the series, is a knitter’s interpretation of a curiosity cabinet. It is an assemblage of lace and cables and ribbings (instead of the more traditional rocks and shells and leaves) that have been brought together to create 18 new patterns. In this book you'll find nine socks, three hats, three cuffs, two shawls, and a cowl. 

There’s sure to be something worthy of being added to your own collection of knitted treasures.

Along the journey, there were other deviations that weren’t included in the book: Dol Guldur, the White Council, even Radagast for goodness sake. But Tauriel was going to be slightly harder to let slide. I was ready to loathe her; to tell my friends that she was terrible; to refrain from buying the Special Extended version just because of her presence in the film. But to my surprise, the opposite happened.

Tauriel is inspired by the eponymous elf and architecture in Thranduil’s palace. Depending on how you look at the intricacy of the twisted travelling stitch pattern, the socks could be soft and rounded, or hard and angular; just like Tauriel. The gusset stitches and toe feature a twisted stitch ribbing that adds to the downward flow of these socks. They are best knit in a solid or semi-solid color, so that any crazy color patterning doesn’t have a jarring effect on your fabric.

Tauriel was first published in the Winter 2014 issue of *Knitty*.

Sometimes something is too much fun to just do once!  That was the case for the lovely stitch on these socks.  It looks smashing worked as an all over pattern (as in the yellow version), but it also lends itself to both a more sedate rib (as on the blue version) and to something a bit fancier (as on the gray version).  

Best of all, you don't have to decide which version you want to make until you've worked the first few inches, so you can totally play it by ear and see what the knitting fates have in mind for you!  

<hr><hr><hr>

They're written in four sizes (60, 66, 80, and 88 stitch cast ons), and you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the sock. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a sturdy sock fabric with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 7, 8, or 9 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for the size you need. With that range of sizes and gauges, the socks will fit a foot (measured around the ball of the foot) between 7.75 and 13 inches (with lots of points in between).

**These are perfect for you if:**
* You're feeling indecisive
* You want lots of options with your socks
 
**They’re** ***not*** **for you if:**
* You don't like charts (the pattern uses charts)
* You hate swatching (you need to swatch to check your needle size)

Updated and expanded, this delightful new edition of Silk Road Socks features sixteen intricate patterns inspired by oriental rugs.

All fourteen of the original patterns are here, each revised to fit my current style and with extra sizes added (that includes sizing them all for both fingering weight yarn and dk/sport weight yarn).  There are also two brand new patterns available here for the first time ever.  And of course along the way I’ve upgraded all the fun bits (new photos, new charts, beautiful illustrations…all the things that help make a book lovely)!

Every paper copy of the book includes a unique code (look inside the back cover) that allows you to download a copy of the electronic book.  You'll be able to store the electronic version in your ravelry library if you like (though a ravelry membership isn't required to access the electronic version).

*Mashad, located in the northeastern corner of Iran, is the second largest city in the country and the site of an important religious shrine. It is widely considered one of the most beautiful Iranian cities.*

*Mashad is in the center of one of the best wool-producing regions in the Middle East, and rugs from this area are both soft and durable. Many of the rugs made in the past used cochineal to dye the wool, which gave a deep magenta (sometimes almost purplish) cast to the rugs. This magenta shade, along with the intensely decorated corner brackets common to these rugs, are both emphasized in these socks.*

- 
A labyrinth is one continuous path that spirals to a central point. The terms labyrinth and maze are often used interchangeably, however, a maze differs in that it is a puzzle with wrong turns and false paths. Labyrinths have been made for thousands of years all around the world. They appear as structures, wall paintings, pottery, and even woven into baskets. Historians classify them into different types. 

This sock pattern includes several types of labyrinths from the Classical family of Labyrinths. There are many 3-circuit classic labyrinths, a 7-circuit classic labyrinth (sometimes referred to as a Cretan labyrinth), and a Baltic labyrinth (also called the goddess labyrinth). 

There is only one size for this pattern. 

**Materials:**
YARN: MC: 250yds fingering weight and CC: 250yds fingering weight - Yarns need to have a high contrast between them. Solid colors work best, but if using a multi, be sure there is no color overlap.
NEEDLES: US1.5 (2.5mm) or size to obtain gauge

Thick ‘beanstalk’ ribbing is created with slipped stitches, and a photo tutorial guides you through German Short Rows along the heel. After the heel flap, a bit of knitting magic transforms the beanstalk ribbing into complex cables that create a ‘castle’ of archways along the leg of the sock. Worked in Rainbow Heirloom’s gorgeous semi-solid sock yarn, these socks are sure to stand out, even if you don’t have your own beanstalk to climb. *(NOTE: Experience with cabling is recommended. Cables are both charted and written.)*

*“There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition.” – Catelyn Stark,* Game of Thrones

Cersei Lannister is a formidable woman with the pride and ruthlessness of a lion, the sigil of her house banner. Known for their wealth and power, the Lannisters are one of the richest and most powerful families in Westeros. Although they may have the appearance of cables, these socks are as deceptive and clever as Cersei herself. These top-down socks use yarnovers, decreases, and wrapping techniques to only give the illusion of cables. Stacks of golden ‘coins’ are created down the leg of the sock, framed by regal diamonds to produce this stand-out footwear Fit for a Queen.

These socks are knit in two colors from the cuff down. They feature a ribbed cuff with contrast stripes, a honeycomb brioche pattern along the front of the leg and instep, and two vertically stranded contrast stripes framing the brioche. They are worked with a contrast heel flap, a gusset, and a wedge toe.

As the name “Will You Marl Me?” suggests, you can marl this sock by using fingering weight held double, or you can use any DK or worsted weight yarn that fits the gauge.

I wanted to make a marled sock design, because I feel like it’s harder to find DK or worsted yarn that’s appropriate for socks, and many sock knitters have a slew of fingering weight sock yarn lying about!

These socks have two chunky, cozy texture patterns for the foot to pick from. One has ridges (the blue sample) which echo the ridges on the leg, and the other (pink sample) does not, in case ridges on top of the foot are not desired. Either way, you’ll get a cozy sock that hugs the
foot!

1296050,Pathways Socks,Oakwood Knits,4.0,30.0,4.0,"38 sts x 50 rnds = 4"" in slip stitch cable pattern, blocked",400.0,"Elongated slip stitches, cable crosses, and linen stitch texture create the winding paths on the front of the sock. This pattern is designed to work best with yarn that has subtle color shifts, which make the slip stitches shine. I recommend using a low contrast variegated yarn with an even spread or semisolid / tonal yarn (yarn that is dyed one color but still has some slight tonal variation) for best results. High contrast yarns that are very busy won’t work as well because all of the color will drown out the design. 

The slip stitch fabric creates a tighter fabric compared to stockinette stitch, so if you are in between sizes I would go with the larger size. If socks with your usual stitch count already fit very snugly, I recommend going up a size. Samples are shown in Size M on a 8.75” / 22 cm foot circumference.

A demo is included on how to work these cables without a cable needle.

**Construction**
These socks are knit toe-up, with the pattern starting almost immediately at the start of the toe and is worked at the same time as the toe increases, and then continuing the length of the foot. A shadow wrap short row heel is used but you can substitute another heel method. After finishing the heel, the pattern is continued where you left off on the leg, finishing with a ribbed cuff. Both charts and written instructions are provided.

This was a case of yarn inspiring pattern.  When I saw these beautiful colors, I immediately thought of a cauldron.  And a broom.  And a witch’s hat.  And a cat.

Why not a cat wearing the hat on a broom?  So I set to work, and realized that to keep things as simple as possible, I made sure this design could be done with 2-color stranded knitting, while using duplicate stitch for a few of the elements (like the hat.)

To make sure this fits well, a few extra stitches are added to the colorwork sections, and the cat section is knit on a bigger needle than the rest of the sock.  More instructions and suggestions to make sure the socks fit well are in the pattern as well.

The charts in the main pattern are in color, but there is an extra file with black and white charts with symbols that can be used as is, or colored with colored pencils.

7294065,Peppermint Sticks Ice Cream Socks,Oakwood Knits,0.0,32.0,4.0,,,"> This is one of a set of very easy sock patterns part of the Vanilla Sundae Sock Set! These patterns are meant for times when you want a mostly mindless knitting project you can pick up and put down easily, but also want something a little more interesting than a plain vanilla sock - hence, the ""Vanilla Sundae"" name. All 6 patterns are also available together in an ebook for the best total price! The ebook also comes with a **BONUS 15-page Vanilla Sock Recipe** written for both cuff-down and toe up constructions, an expanded 12 sizes, guidance on how to adjust sizing for your own stitch and round gauge, as well as plenty of other tips so that you can create handknit socks you will actually wear! I hope you enjoy these sock patterns, and happy knitting!

The little splashes of color in this main color reminded me of a scoop of peppermint ice cream, and the stripes of peppermint sticks. These easy socks feature little stripes throughout the foot and leg, and are perfect for sock sets, mini skeins (especially 10g ones), and scraps! This pattern is great for knitters new to changing colors, as instructions for how to do so are included. I remember when I first started knitting, I stuck with one color projects for a long time because I had no idea how you were supposed to change colors! (This was pre-youtube days...). So this is a great pattern for new knitters looking to expand their skill set.

I used 6 contrast colors for each sock, but you can use anywhere from 1 to 12 contrast colors for each sock depending on what you have in your stash! Three children sizes and four adult sizes are included. The widths of the stripes are adjusted to accommodate different foot lengths, while maintaining the look of narrow contrast stripes with wide main color stripes. 

**Construction**
Socks are knit toe-up, with 5 thin CC stripes on the foot that alternate with wider MC stripes. These socks use a shadow wrap short row heel, in which you don’t need to wrap the stitches, but you can use another heel method if you prefer. After finishing the heel, the 5 stripes are repeated on the leg in reverse order. It is finished with a 2x2 ribbed cuff, with a decorative trim that uses 2 of the stripe contrast colors of your choosing. In the sample, I mismatched the trim.

**Sizes**

**Yarn**
You will need 1 MC and 6 mini skeins (or equivalent scrap yarn) for CC1 - CC6.

7325376,Four and Twenty Blackbirds,Laura Fox,0.0,36.0,4.0,,400.0,"As a classically-educated lover of books, linguistics, folklore, and rhetoric, I have always found nursery rhymes particularly haunting and evocative. On the surface, they are taught to children as tools of language acquisition and often feature deeper lessons; yet, they also often couch within them entire worldviews, economics, diplomacy, political positions, and cultural cues.

“Sing a Song of Sixpence” is one that has fascinated me for many years, as it has so many various (and divergent) meanings associated with it, from criticism of English monarch Henry VIII, to piracy under the helm of the infamous Blackbeard, to something as benign as a French recipe for royalty. What is the truth? Perhaps we’ll never fully know, or perhaps it is as nuanced as the theories we love to debate over.

Either way, the line “Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie” evokes quite an image. It is mystery, it is intrigue, it is gruesome as well as elegant, with a haunting tone of dark academia meets gothic fairytale - in short, all the things I love about literature, and ripe for exploration in a sock pattern.

I’ve been sitting on the idea of designing a “Four and Twenty Blackbirds” sock for several years now, intending to release it during an autumn month...however, when Pi(e) Day 2024 came around, I thought this would be a fun play on the concept of “pie”.

Each size features 4 blackbirds with 4 matching sets of footprints, knit in colorwork to call back to the “Four and twenty blackbirds” line of the rhyme. “Four and Twenty Blackbirds” works best in two tonal, highly contrasting yarns, but also has a fun twist when worked in a more variegated main color, as shown in the pattern photos. Whatever colors you select, be sure to have a piece of your favorite pie near by to knit to!

Although I'm no longer living in an area where I have a front row seat to the explosion of colors, I still have a great appreciation for the beauty of the season.

These socks are the perfect thing to ward off the dropping temperatures. They are worked from the toe up, with leaves organically growing out of a stockinette toe. The leaves march their way up the sock, past a toe-up heel flap, and transition into a rib that compliments the strong vertical lines of the pattern.

114680,Goneril & Regan,L Abinante,2.65,32.0,4.0,stockinette,400.0,"I am a mass consumer when it comes to popular culture. I love taking it in, critiquing it, and, well, mocking it endlessly. Rock of Love Bus, anyone?

But more to the point: I get inspired by the characters I read about, or watch on film and television, and I decided to knit things that I think would suit them.

Most recently, I read a “revision” of *King Lear* and portrayed his already wicked daughters, Goneril and Reagan, in an even more amusing and delightfully dastardly light. In honor of these two wicked women, I present to you sister socks. Somewhat similar but not identical, these socks are like any set of sisters: built from the same cloth, but different and unique in their own way.

Both socks come in three sizes, with each sock having its own charts and set of instructions. This stitch pattern is very stretchy, and I have provided photos of the socks on both blockers and feet so you may better select a size.

You can purchase the set of sister socks together on Ravelry for $6 – that’s right, *two patterns with three sizes each for $6*.

#### About the Sisters

**Goneril**

Goneril is the eldest daughter of King Lear and the Duchess of Albany. While many of you probably know her from your encounters with William Shakepeare's play *King Lear*, this pattern is not inspired by that Goneril. No, in fact, this pattern was inspired by a different Goneril: the Goneril in Christopher Moore's *Fool*. She's a little bit naughty, and quite a bit greedy. If Goneril could knit, she's the kind of woman who'd definitely keep these socks for herself.

**Regan**

Regan is the second daughter of the same King Lear, and is Duchess of Cornwall. This Regan is also not the one you are familiar with from Shakespeare's grand production. The Regan from Christopher Moore's *Fool* is a cruel, sadistic, and selfish woman. If Regan could knit… well, let's be honest, Regan would never knit. But she wouldn't be shy about using knitting needles to stab her enemies or in some other illicit manner.",,51,225,4.62,"Women's small, medium, and large",Fingering

Curiosity cabinets were collections of wonderful objects brought together to inspire, delight, and inform.

Presented here, in this first volume of the series, is a knitter’s interpretation of a curiosity cabinet. It is an assemblage of lace and cables and ribbings (instead of the more traditional rocks and shells and leaves) that have been brought together to create 20 new patterns. In this book you’ll find ten socks, two hats, three cuffs, three cowls, and two shawls. 

There’s sure to be something worthy of being added to your own collection of knitted treasures.

This combination of techniques is such a great way to knit socks, and I’m excited to teach it. First, toe-up is my favorite way to knit socks, because you can use every bit of the yarn with NO LEFTOVERS. Magic loop sock knitting ends up going faster than using double-pointed needles, because you only have to readjust your needles twice in a round, instead of three or four times.

Nothing keeps your feet warm on a camping trip like heavy wool socks! This design adds interest to an often utilitarian heavy weight sock by incorporating a garter panel with traveling cable on the outside of each ribbed leg. Briggs and Little Tuffy is the perfect yarn for socks that will see heavy duty - it wears like iron! Please note that if you plan on substituting another yarn, the Tuffy is a very heavy worsted - Ravelry lists it as an aran weight. These socks knit up very quickly!

The pattern directions are written for a cuff down sock knit on 4 double point needles. The directions for the traveling stitch leg and foot patterns are given in both written and charted form. The entire pattern is 7 pages. Page 5 consists of only the written out stitch pattern directions for all sizes. The charts for sizes small and medium are on page 6, and the charts for sizes large and extra large are on page 7. So you may choose to print just the pages you need. Alternate toe decreasing directions, for those who prefer a wider toe, are given on [Knitwise Design's website][3].

This pattern is suitable for knitters who are comfortable knitting a basic sock in the round with double point needles and working simple cables. Like all patterns by Knitwise Design, it has been test knit and professionally tech edited to be clear and free of errors.

**Sizes Available:**
S (M, L, XL), to fit foot circumferences of 8 (9, 10, 11) in/ 20.5 (23, 25.5, 28) cm
*A note on choosing size: Please choose your size by foot circumference, not your shoe size. All sizes can be knit to any shoe size length. A table of lengths for common shoe sizes is included in the pattern.*

**Finished Measurements:**
Foot circumference: 6.5 (7.5, 8.25, 9) in/ 16.5 (19, 21, 22.75) cm with unstretched ribbing.
Foot length: adjustable for shoe size.
Leg length: 7.5 in/ 19cm in sizes S and M, and 8.25 in/ 21 cm in sizes L and XL.

**Gauge:**

477282,Octopodes,Jennifer Raymond,6.58,36.0,4.0,stranded colorwork,442.0,"Note: From now until the end of April, Dragonfly Fibers is holding a KAL in their group, found here: [http://www.ravelry.com/discuss/dragonfly-fibers/2871972/1-25#9][1].

Octopodes are a pair socks with stranded colorwork on the foot, and helix knitting to stripe the ankle. All throughout, a pair of stripes shoot up the sides of the socks from toe to top, creating a strong visual line.

I've developed a fondness for cephalopods over the last 10 years. It started in college when one of my biology friends insisted that cuttlefish really were cute, and then extended as I learned just how smart -- in a completely non-human way -- creatures like octopi, squid and cuttlefish are. I wanted to share my geeky love for them. Plus, I love how many different forms of the plural octopus there are. The Oxford English Dictionary lists octopuses, octopi and octopodes as all correct forms. Although, technically octopi is hypercorrect, coming from the mistaken notion that the ūs in octopūs is a Latin second declension ending. Being perverse, I prefer the rarer form of octopodes, which is the ancient Greek plural, oktō-pous being from the Greek, meaning eight-foot.

When planning these socks I had some specific requirements: stranded, for warmth, with an afterthought heel [as I always wear my heels out, and afterthought heels are easier to replace since stranded knitting is a pain to darn in pattern]. However, I knew I wanted to carry the two colors of yarn into the ankle, but at the same time I didn't want the ankle in stranded knitting, as it would be too difficult to fit my heels into the socks. Since I have a fondness for helix striping combined with slip stitches, the ankle is as you see.

**FINISHED MEASUREMENTS**
**Circumference around ball of foot**: 8[8.5, 8.75, 9, 9.5] inches
**Foot length**: 9[9.25, 9.5, 10, 10.25] inches, length can be added to adjust fit
**Height from top of heel**: 6.5[6.75, 7, 7.5, 8], adjustable to fit

A note on sizing: these stranded colorwork socks are not very stretchy. We recommend they be worn with zero ease -- that is, you should choose to make the size that most closely matches your foot circumference. If the sock is too short or too long for you lengthwise but fits your circumference, you can make it shorter or longer by knitting less or more rows in the foot before the chart.

A note on the heel: to accommodate enough room to slide the sock on, extra room has been added to the afterthought heel to increase the heel diagonal. If your heel diagonal is typically shallow, you might not want to work as many rows in the heel, or only work one repeat of the beginning heel decreases before going onto the 2nd heel decrease chart.

512035,"Dyad Socks, Toe Up",Lara Neel,3.47,32.0,4.0,stockinette stitch,525.0,"I chose “dyad” as the name for these socks as a kind of reference to my thought process.
I wanted to explore the easiest way I know to make a two-color sock: one color for the heel and toe, and another for the rest of the sock. I was also eager to use a band heel and a toe to match.
So (in my mind), bands with two colors = two things to do with musical bands = two notes = two notes played together = (a short trip to Google) = dyad. Dyad also means, in many other contexts, sets of two. What could be more perfect for a pair of socks?
I hope you find harmony with these easy socks. The band heel can be worked either with or without a gusset. The sock shown with the green heel is with a gusset, the one with the blue heel is without one.
A sideways toe matches this heel quite nicely. It fits like a wedge toe and can be made short, medium or long, to fit wide, medium, or pointy toes.",,61,57,4.38,"Women’s XS (Women’s S, Women’s M/Men’s S, Women’s L/Men’s M, Men’s L, Adjustable Size)",Fingering

This is a pattern for a pair of socks that is knit from the top (cuff) down on two circular needles, with an *optional* 12-inch needle. The stitches combine the best of two worlds: cable and lace. The placement of the stitches causes one to scratch their heads at how the stitches seem to wander, fooling even those philosophers at the symposium. The cable is tight enough so that the sock is still warm despite the lace treatment, however it is knit with lightweight sock yarn, making it the perfect sock to wear with capri's in the spring, so that you can show off your knitting prowess. The pattern is written for two circular needles.

The focal stitch is both written out and charted.

The directions are written for all three sizes: Small, Medium and Large

Skill Level: Intermediate  (assuming a basic knowledge of knitting, cabling and lace).

The yarn used to make the sample pair is Lorna's Laces Shepherd Sock yarn in the colorway, Blackberry.

I’m not all that sure I do much that falls under the heading of general country sports. But I am a big fan of excellent socks. And these (sized for both ladies and gentlemen, because everyone needs a good sock) fit the bill quite nicely.

Moral of the story: Don’t mess with Nomia.

These socks won’t blind you or turn you into a rock, but they do make me think of nymphs. There's something about the combination of a bit of lace with those 2 stitch cables that brings to mind woodland fairies, sprites, and nymphs.

**Tantamount** adjective *equivalent in value, significance, or effect*

<hr><hr><hr>

I hear again and again that you folks really love basic socks...but basic socks with just enough of a twist to keep things interesting.  If that's what you want in a sock, I think these might be exactly what you're looking for!

The majority of this sock is lovely, meditative stockinette.  But, to keep things interesting, there's a perfect little mirrored cable panel running down the outside of your foot and the inside of your heel.  There are two variations of the panel, one that carries the cabling through the whole sock (that's the blue one), and one that is a bit more restrained (that's the purple one), and both versions are included in the pattern. 

They're both great fun to knit (the cable really is clever...and I suspect they'd pass muster even with those who insist on more mellow socks).  And the end result is so amazingly tidy you can't help but be pleased!  

<hr><hr><hr>

They're written in four sizes (56, 64, 72, and 80 stitch cast on) and you should feel free to adjust your gauge a bit to fine tune the fit of the sock. Just be sure that you’re working at a gauge that gives you a sturdy sock fabric with your chosen yarn!

I recommend working at something around 7, 8, or 9 stitches per inch, and I’ve included a table to help you figure out what gauge you’ll want to use for the size you need. With that range of sizes and gauges, the socks will fit a foot (measured around the ball of the foot) between 6.75 and 12.5 inches (with *lots* of points in between).

<hr><hr><hr>

**These are perfect for you if:**
* You secretly love a plain sock...but not too plain
* You love that tidy little cable

**They’re** ***not*** **for you if:**
* You don't like charts (the pattern uses charts)
* You hate swatching (you need to swatch to check your needle size)

Updated and expanded, this delightful new edition of Silk Road Socks features sixteen intricate patterns inspired by oriental rugs.

All fourteen of the original patterns are here, each revised to fit my current style and with extra sizes added (that includes sizing them all for both fingering weight yarn and dk/sport weight yarn).  There are also two brand new patterns available here for the first time ever.  And of course along the way I’ve upgraded all the fun bits (new photos, new charts, beautiful illustrations…all the things that help make a book lovely)!

Every paper copy of the book includes a unique code (look inside the back cover) that allows you to download a copy of the electronic book.  You'll be able to store the electronic version in your ravelry library if you like (though a ravelry membership isn't required to access the electronic version).

*Serab (sometimes Sarab) is a town in northwestern Iran that serves as a market for rugs from about two dozen villages in the surrounding area.*

*Because of the style of loom used in the region, Serabs are almost always long and narrow. They are usually camel-colored, often with blue and red accents. The strong vertical lines, repeating diamond-shaped motifs, and rich color of this sock all echo elements common to Serabs.*

Anyone is welcome to participate in the SKA knit-a-long, provided they read and follow the guidelines in the SKA group. Anyone at all is welcome to this pattern. I hope you enjoy the work. 

Skill Level: Intermediate. There is a lot of cabling work, pre-strung beads, and several knitting charts to follow. 

Materials: 350-400 yards of sock yarn and a multiple of 40 seed beads in a size appropriate for your yarn (see the info page for more details here). I recommend using a solid or mostly solid color to show off the cables, and a contrasting color of bead.

Needles: US1 (2.25mm) sock needles (or the size needed to obtain gauge). The pattern is written for both DPN style and Magic Loop style knitters, and it makes no difference what your preference is.

Tools: A cable needle (if you need one to work cables), measuring tape, scissors, and a tapestry needle

Sizing: The sock is not very elastic, and if in doubt, I recommend going up a size for more stretch. Small/Medium/Large/XLarge sizes measure approx. 8/9/10/11 inches in circumference and everything else is adjustable.

**Bumblebee Acres Farm’s 
Sock A Day Socks Pattern** 
The Sock A Day Socks Pattern was developed on Bumblebee Acres Farm to make a thick, durable sock to wear in your winter boots, while getting cozy with your knitting, or to fight off cold toes in bed! 

The design has been reworked several times, in several different yarn weights, to create for you a sock that is easy enough for beginner sock knitters, and is super fast to knit! These are the perfecting gifting socks, and have been a stable during any occasion at Bumblebee Acres Farm, being gifted lovingly from knitter to wearer. They create beautiful, cozy socks, and they work up in a flash! 

There are THREE OPTIONS (3 patterns in one!) for creating your Sock A Day Socks- Vanilla, Ribbed, and Broken Rib. All three are quick, easy knits that follow the same basic design, with the only difference being the stitch pattern on the leg and top of foot and the differences in Negative Ease it creates (how snuggly it fits). There are also guidelines for knitting your socks with both worsted and DK weight yarns! 
So, grab your needles, your favorite drink, and let’s cozy up and whip up a sock! 

**Skill Level:** Intermediate Knitting/Beginner Sock Knitting 

**Stitches to know:** Knit, Purl, Slip Stitch, Knit Two Together, Purl Two Together, Slip slip Knit 

**Shown knit in either:** 
-DK/Light Worsted Yarn in approximately 245-345 yards. 
We recommend Bumblebee Acres Farm’s Squishy DK for its softness, squishiness, and durability! 
-Worsted Weight/Fingering Weight held 2 together in approximately 200-300 yards. 
We recommend Bumblebee Acres Farm’s Coquette Sock held 2 together for its quickness, durability and cute marled color. If you use fingering held 2 together, you will need 400-600 yards (which divides into 200-300 yards when held 2 together). 
Note: 100 grams of DK (245 yards) or 100 grams of Worsted (200 yards) will each create a pair of socks with an 8 inch leg in Women’s US shoe sizes up to a size 10. If you are making a sock for longer or wider feet, you will need more yarn. ",5.0,51,55,4.62,"Written for Women's Shoe Sizes 6-11, but is easily adapted.",DK

They are worked in the round from the cuff down, with a durable slipped-stitch heel flap. Dress them up with contrasting cuffs, heels, and toes. Reverse the colors on the second sock to make a fun fraternal pair!

This pattern was designed to be suitable for a first-time sock knitter. Detailed instructions walk you through the entire process, from casting on in the round, working the ribbed leg and the slipped-stitch heel flap, turning the heel, and finishing with a neatly-grafted seamless toe. 

Instructions are given for working socks in the round using the magic loop technique, but stitches can be easily divided over double-pointed needles, if preferred.

**Sizing:**
* Small (fits up to youth US size 4 or women’s US size 6 shoe; approximately 7.5” foot circumference and 8.5” foot length) 
* Medium (fits women’s US size 5-10 shoe; approximately 8.5” foot circumference and 9.5” foot length)

**Gauge:**
13 stitches and 19 rounds per 2” in unstretched stockinette stitch worked in the round. 

Note: This is a tighter gauge than normally suggested for DK-weight yarn, to make durable and long-lasting socks. 

**Fit Notes:**
* A well-fitting sock should stretch gently to fit the foot and should measure (unstretched) approximately 1” smaller than the circumference of adult foot (0.5” for a child) and approximately 0.5” shorter than the length of adult foot (0.25” for a child). 
* If you are in between sizes, choose the size with the closest circumference, as the length is more easily adjusted.
* The ribbed leg and top of the foot add additional stretch.
* If your calf circumference is considerably larger than your foot circumference, consider beginning your sock with a larger needle size and changing to the correct size approximately halfway down the leg. ",3.99,6,8,0.0,"Small (Medium, Large) / approximately Child (Woman, Man)",DK

The Fireside Cable Socks are inspired by warm cups of cocoa and cozy fireside knitting. The flowing cable panels and garter stitch edgings gently highlight that gorgeous skein of speckled yarn that you’ve been stashing for the perfect project, and the easy-to-memorize motif results in a relatively quick knit.

CONSTRUCTION

The Fireside Cable Socks are knit cuff-down, beginning with a German-Twisted Cast-On and 2x2 rib, which aligns perfectly with the cable detail on the leg. A traditional heel flap and gusset are spruced up by a cozy garter edging, and the foot of the sock is finished off with a rounded toe and Kitchener stitch.

RECOMMENDED YARN

This pattern will play nicely with any light fingering to fingering weight merino/merino nylon blend yarn in tonal or lightly speckled colorways.

They do it to imitate a style of running that’s commonly found in anime cartoon series, most popularly “Naruto,” which is about a young ninja. 

My kids have done this since they could walk without having ever seen anime shows, and it absolutely tickles me to see all three of my kids running this way, as well as random strangers.

When I saw that the yarn I had bought was named “Naruto,” there was no doubt in my mind that some Ninja Run socks needed to be designed right away!

I can’t promise these will make you run faster, but you will probably giggle every time you see them, just like I do!

Ninja Run is a toe up, Fleegle Heel sock. That means it has a gusset, but there's NO wrapping and turning!

Bauble Extravaganza is Holiday Cheer and fun knitting all rolled into one! Christmas is my absolute favorite time of the year and I thought it needed commemoration. Bauble Extravaganza has simple cabling and beading every few rows to decorate your tree. Beads not your thing? Easy! Have a lovely pine forest decorate your socks instead. 

Personally, I didn't need a cable needle when knitting these socks but there are instructions for knitting the cables with a cable needle in the pattern. As well as placing the beads in the knitting using a small size crochet hook.

* Sewn BO (written instructions & video link included)

* Inside-out cables (written instructions & video link included)

* Shadow Wrap Short Rows (written instructions, photo tutorial & video link included)

**Design**
A WORSTED weight version of my [Walking on a Dream][2] design.

These toe-up socks are knit inside-out and in the round. The cables are worked from the wrong side of the sock, later to be revealed after you turn them right-side out. The stockinette stitches are on the inside of the sock for a more comfortable footbed. The unique 4x1 ribbed cable creates an optimal amount of stretch on the front of the foot. The heel features shadow wrap short rows. See video link under stitch guide on this page. There’s also a photo tutorial included in the pattern.

The toe is worked in smaller needles for a tighter gauge that creates a reinforced toe. 

Sock pattern includes 2 lengths, regular and shorty. More repeats can be added for even longer socks. Each 20-rnd pattern repeat will add another 3”/7.5 cm to the sock. See gauge below. The pattern includes Charted instructions and Row-for-Row Written instructions.

*“I’ve always imagined that my name was Cordelia-- at least, I always have of late years... But if you call me Anne please call me Anne spelled with an ‘e.’”– Anne Shirley, Anne of Green Gables*

These socks embody her spirit, feauring the ‘Anne with an E’ colorway knit top-down into an elegantly cabled pair of socks. The ribbing features smocked stitches, easily created with the use of a cable needle, while the cables work up quickly with left and right twists (and no cable needle!).

The Boba Time! Socks are inspired by the cold drink of our summers in the San Gabriel Valley in California. This drink of our youth settles in layers of beautiful peach and orange hues, and Jen at 626 Yarns has dyed the perfect gradient set, Thai Iced Tea with a bonus Boba mini. Together we have created this sweet, sticky, super-caffeinated pattern to enjoy. 

Knit a gradient version to achieve the perfect Thai Iced Tea gradient, or knit a solid with a contrasting mini for plain milk tea with boba. Change the colors to achieve other drinks, such as matcha latte, strawberry milk tea, or taro milk tea. The world’s your colorwork oyster. The pattern utilizes interesting techniques throughout in short sections so that it remains engaging. No second sock syndrome here!

But I've long wanted to combine them in a way that the heel could be knit in either direction, toe up or cuff down, and SOHCATOA is the result, combining the familiar triangular gussets with a short-row heel turn.

This pattern includes instructions for knitting the sock in both directions, so you can choose either method or knit one sock of the pair in each direction. At a glance, it's truly hard to tell in which direction a given sock was knit.

To knit this pattern, you need to know how to:

* work in the round in knit and purl,
* work directional increases (LLI and RLI),
* work directional increases (k2tog and SSK),
* work short rows, and
* graft live stitches (if knitting cuff down).

Note that the pattern uses wrap and turn (w&t) for the short rows but does not indicate a specific method. You can use any form of short rows you like.

Most pairs of socks will use about one typical skein of sock yarn. If you have very long and/or wide feet, however, you may need more to complete your pair.

Have you ever seen the tracks left behind by crabs as they scuttle through the sand? Crabs can scuttle sideways, forward, backward, and even diagonally, but they move fastest by walking sideways - these socks were designed to mimic those adorable little tracks!

These socks are knit starting at the cuff and working down toward the toes. The heel flap method is used to work the heel and heel turn, then decreases are worked to shape the gusset. Length is added to the foot, then decreases are worked to shape the toe, finally ending in a kitchener stitch to finish the toe.

The instructions are written to accommodate the magic loop method but are easily worked using double-pointed-needles if preferred! The cable and eyelet motifs are worked using charts.

The instep of a sock is an important part of sock construction – so why not highlight it? Introducing the Step In Sock: the cozy color-blocked sock that emphasizes your instep. 

This basic sock is knit from the toe up and features a gusset on the bottom of the foot and a turned heel, heel flap, and instep in a contrast color. Much of the sock is in glorious (and quick!) stockinette. Only one color is used at a time, so there is no complicated color management.

**What test knitters had to say:**

* ""I like the gusset under the foot. I like that it's a very simple design, but then with a small hidden feature.""
* ""They are quite quick and the gusset shaping is more interesting than a lot of other sock patterns.""
* ""It was fun to knit, with colour changes you’re always eager to keep going. Am grateful you wrote the jogless join into the pattern, makes for a nicer looking finished product.""
* ""I can imagine so many fun colour blocking combos being put together for this pattern.""

It has black text, size 22 or larger text in a sans serif font, no italics, no columns, and fully-written directions. The chart is still included but is not needed to work the pattern. Many thanks to Gemma Thompson (gemmabelle here on Rav) and the Accessible Patterns group for their guidance in formatting patterns in a more accessible way.

Some species of octopus, when frightened, will exhibit a sudden change in coloration to confuse or distract a predator. This allows the octopus time to escape. When an animal uses this technique to protect itself, it’s called deimatic behavior.

The Deimatic Socks are inspired by the majestic octopus, which also happens to be the emblem of Sea Change Fibers, who provided the yarn for this design. These socks are knit from the cuff down with a 1x1 twisted rib cuff. They feature front and back panels of cabled coin lace that twists back and forth. There are two columns of coin lace and two panels on each sock, for a total of eight columns per pair of socks--just like the eight tentacles of an octopus. The heel is constructed with a classic heel flap and gusset for the snuggest and most customizable fit, and the socks end with a wedge toe.

1249411,Woodland Dream Socks,Anna Viadero,3.0,32.0,4.0,stranded SS,300.0,"Easy two color top down socks using needles you prefer (DPN, two circs...). A great beginning to stranded knitting of socks.

It is assumed you are familiar with making top down socks on your preferred needles so specific mechanical instructions for each approach are not included.

Materials:
US 1 or 2 DPNs or circular needles to make gauge
300 yards fingering weight MC/background color (I used Knitpicks Stroll Black #23701 231 yds/50 gms).
300 yards fingering weight CC/motif color (I used Knitpicks Chroma Tiki #28041 396 yds/100gms for CC)
Stitch marker
Darning needle for finishing

Consider using a solid MC and handpainted CC as long as none of the handpainted colors is the same as the solid. You will get a more complicated, fair isle-ish look. Handpainted yarns will change color quickly (within inches)—variegated yarns like Chroma have a longer color change so slower more blended look like watercolor vs fair isle. Self-striping yarn does not change colors quick enough to work well.
Consider for these handpainted yarns for CC: Knitpicks Hawthorne Speckle, Cascade Heritage Wave or Cascade Heritage Paints, others…

Be careful to carry yarns consistently so you achieve the correct yarn dominance—CC coming from the left lets motif and stripes pop.

1261811,Sundown Sock Set,Oakwood Knits,0.0,30.0,4.0,,1358.0,"3 sock patterns included in this set!  Each sock style plays with a different type of stripe patterning in different amounts of yarns to achieve unique looks. These are designed to work especially well with variegated and speckled yarns. The light colorwork on Overcast and Dusk is meant to resemble large speckles to reflect the speckled yarn. Solids or tonal yarns will result in a crisper look. 

Overcast (left side in the first image) uses 4 colors of roughly similar amounts. The colors fade into each other gradually across the entire sock, and include a touch of colorwork on the foot and leg.

Sunset (center) is designed for minis and uses 7 colors total: a 6-color fade plus 1 neutral color. The colorful stripes alternate to form a gradient over the sock starting from the toe and ending at the cuff, broken up by single rounds of the neutral color. 

Dusk (right) is designed for 1 MC and small quantities of 3 contrast colors - scraps would work great for this one! The color changes occur near the start and the end, with a long stretch of stockinette in MC in between that makes for easy knitting. 

**Optional foot shaping for high insteps**
These patterns include optional shaping at the top of the foot. I like my handknit socks to fit very snug, but found the size that fits comfortably around most of my foot becomes too small at the height of the instep, and after some experimentation I found that adding increases at that point helped achieve a better fit. I’ve included this shaping here in order to help others who also have high instep or otherwise find themselves with the same problem. The shaping is completely optional and clearly marked, so if your socks fit your foot well with a consistent stitch count throughout, please skip the shaping! The designs won’t be affected.

**Construction**
Socks are knit toe-up. All patterns use a shadow wrap short row heel, in which you don’t need to wrap the stitch. You can use another short row heel method if you prefer. Four sizes are included, but any multiple of 4 will work for the stitch patterns, so additional sizes can be achieved by decreasing or increasing stitch count. Charts and written instructions are included for the Overcast and Dusk socks.

These socks features a simple seed stitch pattern with honeycomb cables up the side. They have a traditional heel flap construction and a gusset with decreases at the bottom of the foot instead of the sides.

When I first sat down to create these socks, I knew I wanted to make something visually striking, symmetrical, and probably something geometric.  However, as I was creating, this is what flowed out of my hands.  As the waves took shape, I knew I wanted them to be not-quite-regular, with slight varying differences in width.  This ended up creating a slight illusion of movement on the chart when viewed on screen.  Perfect.

This pattern works best when using two highly contrasting yarns, and while I used a self striping yarn for one of mine, they will look equally stunning in two solid colors.

-----

I have extensive notes in this pattern to help you get well-fitting colorwork socks.  There are also links to two of my video tutorials for knitting stranded colorwork socks inside out, as well as the Ladderback Jacquard (LBJ) technique.

While the floats for most of this sock are short enough that you do not need to catch them or use LBJ, there are a couple of areas that can benefit from it.  This would be a good time to learn or practice LBJ in a limited capacity.

Inverse color charts are included in a separate file.

7288307,Marriage of Convenience Socks,Lauren Rad,0.0,32.0,4.0,stockinette in the round after blocking,440.0,">This pattern includes a second PDF version that is formatted for knitters with low vision. It has black text, size 22 or larger text in a sans serif font, no italics, no columns, and fully-written directions. Many thanks to Gemma Thompson (gemmabelle here on Rav) for her guidance in formatting patterns in a more accessible way.

A marriage of convenience story almost needs no explanation. Two people who don’t love each other decide to get married anyway because it provides other benefits they need. Along the way, though, something happens, and they end up falling in love even though they didn’t plan it and perhaps don’t even want it. The best-laid schemes of mice and men, eh?

When I bought the yarn for these socks, I knew I needed to name this pattern Marriage of Convenience. That’s because the colorway name is “Duke of Hawtness,” and when I asked the dyer (Shelia Anderson of Urban Girl Yarns), she confirmed it was named for Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings—AKA the Bridgerton Guy. I had a good chuckle and knew it was fate.

These socks are knit from the top down with a ribbed cuff, heel flap and gusset, and wedge toe. They are graded to five sizes for a wider range of fit. The ribbing that runs the length of the sock helps keep them snug and supportive.

I imagine knitting these socks on cold winter nights, cozied up on the couch with a favorite blanket, while snow is falling outside - or whenever winter vibes are needed!

As snowflakes have six points, I am calling these eight and four pointed creations “knitflakes.”  The big knitflake on top of the foot is an accent chart that is interchangeable with the main chart, which means you can easily move it to another part of the sock, such as the leg, if you desire.  The socks are also mirrored, except for the accent chart, which is the same for both.

Use miniskeins to play with color as I have done, or make the background all one color, the choice is yours!  I hope you have as much fun knitting them as I did creating them.

-----

This pattern includes two files: the main one with the pattern and smaller charts, and a separate file with larger (and inverse color) charts.

-----

I have lots of notes in this pattern to help you achieve well-fitting colorwork socks.  I also include links to two videos with helpful techniques for knitting stranded colorwork socks.  These videos include knitting a colorwork sock inside-out, and using Ladderback Jacquard.

**Gauge:**  36 stitches and 42 rows to 4” (10cm) worked in stranded colorwork, unblocked.

I give gauge unblocked, as it’s more realistic to check your gauge on socks as you knit.  Also, while blocking makes them look nice, realistically they need to fit your feet without relying on blocking.  The socks will naturally block on your feet.

He wore 70s style athletic socks with sneakers and pedaled his Big Wheel as fast as lightening. This sock pattern will let you make socks just like the ones we used to wear in the 70s, back when basketball players actually wore Chuck Taylors on the court.

This fully tech-edited and beautifully formatted pattern is for:

* Top-down socks with a heel flap and gusset, which is the style most likely to fit most feet
* Three sizes: for narrow, standard, and wide feet. 
* Beginners and advanced knitters alike
* Learning something new with a video tutorial for my recommended extra-stretchy cast-on
* Using my hand-dyed yarn (kits are [here][1]) or with scraps from stash

***
My little brother died in a car crash in the early 90s when he was just 20, so these socks are a poignant reminder to me that life is both fragile and joyful, happy and sad all at once. They’re for everyone who wants to remember a loved one, for everyone who wants to reconnect with the kid inside, and for everyone who wants to play with color.

**In other words, they’re for you and for me and for little brothers everywhere.**

*What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet...*

Do you call this stitch pattern Broken Rib, or Garter Rib? When knitting in the round, they're one and the same! 

These broken rib (or garter rib, if you prefer) socks are knit toe up, with a heel flap and gusset. A link to a calculator for your gusset increases is included in the pattern.

Don't worry about ""getting gauge"" with these socks -- you can use your preferred sock yarn+needle combination that gives you a fabric you like, measure your row gauge, and pop that into the calculator. Your stitch gauge does matter to an extent, but the broken rib pattern is relatively stretchy. If in doubt, send me a message and I can help with the math of finding your size.

There are three separate PDFs included in your purchase; one for each size. I find it much easier to work off a pattern that is specific to one stitch count. Of course, you can download all 3 patterns and knit this sock in every size if you so choose!

SIZING
Size small (56 stitches) will fit feet 6"" to 8"" in circumference
Size medium (64 stitches) will fit feet 7"" to 9"" in circumference
Size large (72 stitches) will fit feet 8"" to 10"" in circumference 

MATERIALS
You will need (1) 100g skein of sock yarn 
A 32"" or longer circular needle for magic loop, size US 1 (2.25mm) or preferred sock needle size
A measuring tape or ruler for checking your row gauge
A tapestry needle for weaving in ends

The yardage required for this project depends on your gauge, shoe size, and the length you choose to knit the leg. For most feet, a single 100g skein of fingering weight sock yarn is more than enough.

The light blue socks (size small) took 70g of Knomad Stratus, which is approximately 306 yards.
The green socks (size medium) took 76g of Knomad Snowdrift, which is approximately 332 yards.
The darker blue socks (size medium) took 85g of Knomad Duo, which is approximately 340 yards.

Please contact me with any questions or concerns about the pattern. If you need additional sizing, let me know, and I would be happy to extend the pattern for you!

-----------------------------------------------

This project was inspired by the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and all of the action that happened in the Water Cube. Each sock has a wavy lace motif and a strong center seam like a swimmer wiggling through the pool. The cuff is worked with a picot edge for an added splash, and the sides alternate between ribbing and reverse-stockinette for a cube-like effect. The star toe is like a spiral high dive. Have fun with these socks and go for gold!

This pattern was originally available only for those who purchased fall 2008 sock kits from Fresh From the Cauldron.

Details:
Foot circumference: 6.5 [7.5, 8.5] inches (16 [18.5, 21] cm) unstretched. 
Will comfortably stretch to fit 8 [9, 10] inches (20 [23, 25.5] cm).

This pattern is worked from the top down with a picot cuff, twisted ribbing, water cube lace, slip-stitch heel flap, and a star toe. Sizes are snug to allow for negative ease. The lace pattern is charted as well as written; take your pick.

Simple and classic mosaic/slipped stitch pattern that can be knit for either a man or a woman, given the right colors. Easy colorwork without the stranding/floats! If you can slip a stitch, you can knit this design!

The colors should contrast very strongly to work best for this pattern but just about **any** combo works....even colors you would usually *never* put together!

Depending on the size of your foot and the length of your leg you will need approx. 350 yards for the main color.

You will need less than 20 grams or about 50 yards for each of the 2 contrasting colors.

126565,Outside In,Janice Kang,4.01,34.0,4.0,stockinette st,558.0,"*A note from the designer*:
Gauge is important to the fit of this sock. A 3x1 rib knit on a bias is not as stretchy as when knit straight, so keep that in mind when choosing yarn and needles. The socks pictured in the pattern were knit with Panda Superwash (186 yds/50 gms) on US1 needles. They're size Medium and fit my size 8 feet.

So if you’re planning making OI with a thinner yarn and/or smaller needles, or if you’re going to work M1 increases instead of yo’s, consider making a larger size.

********************

Outside In is worked entirely inside out, so the majority of stitches are worked as knit stitches. When the sock is finished, turn it right side out (or should that be outside in?), and voila!, the ribs become spines on a field of purl stitches with sweet columns of eyelets down the center front and back.

A gusset provides more room for the instep. As an added bonus, reversing the sock gives you a fabric suitable for any Princess and the Pea, with the smooth side of the stockinette pampering your sole.

Mystery sock designed for the SolidSocks ravelry group. Will be released as 4 clues starting March 2010. It will be a charted, top-down sock with heel gusset. 

About the name... I'm a huge Agatha Christie fan and have been for many, many years. One of the TV series has an episode in which Miss Marple joins her neighbors for ""Tea and Scandal"". I always loved this and thought a mystery sock deserved such a name. Enjoy!

Because I wanted the pattern to flow along the front of the leg and instep in the same orientation as was shown in the pattern book, I had to work the socks from the toe up. I added another pattern at the sides of the leg to bring the stitch count to an appropriate number for a leg circumference. The pattern I chose involves twisted stitches to coordinate with the main stitch pattern, but I added four-stitch groups of wrapped stitches to add to the textural look. For design continuity on the front of the leg, I extended the wrapped-stitch pattern along the instep. I chose to work a short-row heel to minimize design interruption at the heel, but it would have been nice to extend the wrapped-stitch pattern along the flap of a round heel (worked from the toe up) as well. For the cuff, I maintained the wrapped-stitch pattern at the sides of the leg, but discontinued the traveling stitches in the wings pattern and worked a tiny cable pattern at the center of the motif.

This technique, which I first used in a published design in my 2009 book, **Personal Footprints for Insouciant Sock Knitters**, is one of my favorite techniques to pass on to knitters. 

**The key is mirror symmetry, which harmonizes whimsical movements and renders them elegant. You really can ignore my charts and spontaneously smock columns together as the mood strikes you**. 

Your reward will be a unique design that is balanced and sparkling with life instead of predictability. If I could sit beside you, I would pester you until you set the charts aside and tried it. I hope that learning this technique will inspire you to create your own menagerie of socks. 

Please consider letting the second sock be a bit different than the first. The fashion police who judged you in middle school are not lying on the floor closely studying your handknit socks (and if they are, as my friend Lucy Neatby says, gently kick them). Once you experience the innocent pleasure of abandoning imaginary rules, you may find freedom filtering into the rest of your life.

Curiosity cabinets were collections of wonderful objects brought together to inspire, delight, and inform.

Presented here, in this second volume of the series, is a knitter’s interpretation of a curiosity cabinet. It is an assemblage of lace and cables and ribbings (instead of the more traditional rocks and shells and leaves) that have been brought together to create 18 new patterns. Inside you’ll find nine socks, three hats, three cuffs, two cowls, and one shawl.

There’s sure to be something worthy of being added to your own collection of knitted treasures.

Curiosity cabinets were collections of wonderful objects brought together to inspire, delight, and inform.

Presented here, in this second volume of the series, is a knitter’s interpretation of a curiosity cabinet. It is an assemblage of lace and cables and ribbings (instead of the more traditional rocks and shells and leaves) that have been brought together to create 18 new patterns. Inside you’ll find nine socks, three hats, three cuffs, two cowls, and one shawl.

There’s sure to be something worthy of being added to your own collection of knitted treasures.

**Sizes available:** The pattern features a wonderful array of sizes, from toddler to adult extra-large, so that you can knit these socks for the Little and Big Nutbrown Hares in your life, and every size in between.

**Yarn:** The socks were designed using Must Stash Yarn Perfect Sock, which is the perfect blend of softness and strength. Little Skein's kits included a skein of this beautiful, hand-dyed yarn, but you can use any favorite fingering weight sock yarn.

**HEEL:**  Spacious OMG heel

**Skills needed:** To knit these socks, you will need to:
* Be familiar with sock construction or be an adventurous beginner
* Read a chart
* Cable stitches (with or without a cable needle)

The traveling cable pattern is easy to follow, and for intermediate sock knitters, the pattern will be a breeze. 

The pattern has been written for two circular needles, but it can be easily adapted to other sock knitting techniques such as magic loop or double-pointed needles. Feel free to use the method with which you are most comfortable.

The pattern was tech-edited by Elizabeth Green Musselman of Dark Matter Knits.

19,000+ stitches in a pair of socks and each one a prayer! Even while fighting cancer herself, Elizabeth made dozens of pairs of prayer socks for friends, loved ones, and strangers who needed those prayers. This is her pattern, compiled from the entries on her blog. Knit from the top down with minimal purling, it has a hem at the top (photo tutorial included), short row heel and toe and is what she found to be the easiest way for her to knit socks and to teach others to knit them.

The Nursing Mothers' Sewing List is a group of moms who became close friends online because of a common bond over pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding and sewing our own clothing. We miss Elizabeth dearly, she was a vital part of our group. We wanted to honor her part in our lives by sharing her pattern with the world and using it to help support a cause that was dear to her heart.

When my husband and I take the long drive from Kentucky to my Dad’s house in Delaware, we travel along the twisting and spiraling roads of West Virginia and Maryland. Most of our trip is spent going around and over mountains and then back down as we get into Maryland.

Mount Airy is the highway sign I always look for when we finally reach the Baltimore/Washington DC area. It means we’re only two hours away. Although we’re never in Mount Airy for an extended length of time, it’s always a comforting place after the long drive, and it means we’ll be in Delaware before we know it.  

Mount Airy Socks are written for top-down and toe-up and has three sizes now available. The pattern works well with a rounded fingering weight yarn. The stitch pattern does a great job complimenting variegated and speckled yarns and adds a bit of interest without getting lost in the yarn.

Different sizes can be achieved easily when using a toe-up pattern just by increasing the number of rows knit.

I use a short-row heel which eliminates having to pick up stitches along the arch.

I knit this pair with the pattern going up the top of the foot which caused it to shorten the top a bit. I tried to adjust for this by knitting as loosely as possible on the top and tighter for the sole.

I used a 2 X 2 ribbing for the cuff and used the following stretchy bind off.

To me, cables help keep socks interesting.  To offset the fact that cables suck (in a good way), the sock is worked in rib.  The cables themselves cross the purl stitch of the rib, making them a little persnickity.  One cable set goes down the heel flap while the other meanders down the foot.

Updated and expanded, this delightful new edition of Silk Road Socks features sixteen intricate patterns inspired by oriental rugs.

All fourteen of the original patterns are here, each revised to fit my current style and with extra sizes added (that includes sizing them all for both fingering weight yarn and dk/sport weight yarn).  There are also two brand new patterns available here for the first time ever.  And of course along the way I’ve upgraded all the fun bits (new photos, new charts, beautiful illustrations…all the things that help make a book lovely)!

Every paper copy of the book includes a unique code (look inside the back cover) that allows you to download a copy of the electronic book.  You'll be able to store the electronic version in your ravelry library if you like (though a ravelry membership isn't required to access the electronic version).

*Joshaqan (sometimes Joshagan) is a small town in Iran northwest of Isfahan. The history of rug making in Joshaqan is contested. Some early nineteenth-century carpet scholars have suggested that it was one of the major rug producing areas of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries while some more recent scholars have found this unlikely and suggested that the rug industry did not begin in the area until the nineteenth century.*

*In either case, the rug industry in Joshaqan is thriving today and produces carpets with a very distinctive style. Joshaqan rugs feature a lattice design with stylized floral motifs in the center of the lozenges. Red is common, but neutral colors are also frequently seen. This sock mirrors this traditional lattice design and muted color scheme.*

The Super Fit Sock uses strategically placed ribbing to mimic a running sock, providing an extra-snug fit that hugs the heel and won't slip in your shoes.  This pattern gets consistently good reviews from both experienced and newer sock knitters because it creates a sock that fits well and feels great!

During my last reading of it, I was struck by the description of Smaug as having a ""waistcoat of diamonds"". Inspired by that phrase, I designed these socks.

There are four size options, ranging from adult small to extra-large, so whether you are a hobbit, a dwarf, an elf, a man, or a troll, you should be able to find a size that fits you.

One 100-gm skein of fingering weight sock yarn should be enough for most sizes, though if you have large feet you may wish to have an extra skein.

839247,Flint Ridge Socks,Melissa House,2.29,15.0,2.0,stockinette,450.0,"deThis sock is designed to fit the average adult foot. Size is totally customizable though, please message me if you need help adjusting the width.

I designed these socks because I couldn’t quite find the perfect toe-up chevron sock pattern. I came across this amazing yarn on vacation this spring and had to cast on immediately. My husband and I spent a few days driving Highway 101 and camping in the best spots we could find. Near Crescent City, a wonderful park ranger told us to camp up Flint Ridge, saying that we would get lovely views of the ocean, and that we’d be camping in the Redwoods. These socks are named after that magical place, it was the best campsite we had on the whole trip! The toe on the sock beginning with green makes me think of the majestic redwood forests, and the blue one, of the ocean and sand.

This yarn is self striping, so there was no changing colors to get the striped effect. However, if you want to stripe your socks, just change colors every 5 rows and you will get a similar effect.

Happy knitting!

858304,In a Hole In the Ground,Claire Ellen,3.0,34.0,4.0,Stockinette,400.0,"~This sock is part of a year-long club, and can only be purchased as part of that club until September 2019, when it will be available for individual sale. Thanks for understanding.~

“In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.” 
— J.R.R. Tolkien, The Hobbit
These opening lines from the novel The Hobbit are hopefully prophetic, and you find the socks also to be comfortable. I wanted to recreate the feeling of Hobbit architecture, so there’s an oak/acorn motif at the top, and simple swirly cables and long vertical lines running down the leg. 

Skill-level: Intermediate— the top lace section has no rest rows, but after that, it’s pretty basic. 
Materials: 350-400 yards (320-365m) of sock yarn. The socks pictured are a size Medium and used approximately 370 yards of Miss Babs Cosmic Hand-painted sock yarn in the color Dragon’s Flight. Naturally, leg height and foot length will affect the overall yarn consumption.
Needles: US1 (2.25mm) sock needles. Pattern is written for both DPNs and Magic Loop. Use the needle size that gives you the best fabric and closest gauge.
Tools: Cable needle(s), if necessary; tape measure, scissors, tapestry needle.
Gauge: 34 stitches and 48 rounds per 4 inches or 10 cm in stockinette stitch.
Sizing: Small (Medium, Large) sizes measure approximately 7(8.5,10) inches or 17.8(21.6,25.4) cm. around the cuff. Leg height, ankle depth, and foot length are all adjustable to size and preference. 
Note on sizing: this pattern is not overly elastic nor is it restrictive. It should fit snugly, but not be impossible to stretch over the heel. The sizing differences are rather drastic, however, so please choose the size that most closely fits your desired measurements.

*“I’m in love with Montana. For other states I have admiration, respect, recognition, even some affection. But with Montana it is love.”*
- John Steinbeck, *Travels with Charley*

Chasm is a toe-up sock designed to pair the comfort of cozy ribbed socks with the attractive and whimsical effects of lace knitting. Inspired by the deep and intricate chasms within Montana’s mountainous terrain, these socks form a break in the ribbed texture on the instep to make way for decorative lace. This striking crevasse grows along the instep and wraps its way around the leg, creating a clever and inviting pair of woolen socks.

*“Dracarys. ” 
– Daenerys Targaryen,* Game of Thrones

“Dracarys” is the command given to the dragons of Daenerys Targaryen. With this single word, the people and lands of Westeros can go Up in Flames. These socks embody the fiery spirit of the Mother of Dragons. Beginning at the toe, ribbing works its way up the instep of the sock. Just before the heel, the ribbing begins to shift and change as flame-like cables are worked up the leg of the sock. Knit with four mini-skeins, instructions are given on how to fade the colors into one another. Blending the colors, the fire quickly comes to life, creating the hottest footwear in Westeros.

998448,Step Aside,Jill Bickers,3.25,33.0,4.0,Stockinette st,420.0,"I love slipped stitches. They are a quick and easy way to add interest and texture to any knitting project. If you cross slipped stitches over a field of stockinette, it's even more true. This design does something unusual—the slipped stitches are formed in stockinette columns, but cross to meet in the purl section of a rib. It makes it look like the stitches have decided to “step aside” from the path laid out for them. 

In a solid or semisolid color, the sock looks beautiful and classic. Don’t think you are confined to solids, though! Variegated yarns get a chance to really shine in this sock, as the stitch pattern breaks up pooling. This is a great pattern for those beautiful, wild skeins that you can’t resist buying but don’t quite know what to do with. The stitch pattern is simple, perfect for travel knitting or for social knitting.

Socks are cast on at the cuffs and worked from the top down seamlessly in the round. The heel is worked as a traditional heel flap, then the foot of the sock is also worked in the round down to the toes which are grafted closed with Kitchener Stitch.

As the plow rumbles by, all sounds are hushed and muffled, soaked up by the wet February snow. The storm started before sunrise and cloaks the sky in clouds of thick flakes, and even though there is no sun shining, inside is bright and illumed from the white world behind the panes. Heaters are blowing warm air through the building, book pages lay open. Warm and fluffy, the pale grey comforter beckons. The roads are too messy to travel on--only cocoa will meet this situation head on--and pajamas seem better suit than jeans. The richly textured socks beckon, wanting to languish in books all day.

The length of the leg and foot are adjustable to suit your size, and with three colors, it’s perfect for using up leftover yarn from your stash.

I am a plant lover, but I must admit that my plants suffer when I get busy and focus on the people and animals (and knitting) in my life! For this reason, I LOVE Philodendron plants. I find them practically impossible to kill from neglect. I have gone months without watering the vining plants, and when somebody mentions that it looks sad over in the corner, I water the Philodendron and it seems to spring back to life!

These lacework socks were inspired by the trailing Philodendron plant, with columns of alternating leaves that flow down the leg right to the toe. Rather than a heel flap, the gusset is created by adding stitches between the instep and heel stitches while working in the round, then short rows are worked on the heel before resuming in the round to finish the foot and toe. The instep decreases are worked in part by completing leaves without beginning new ones. There is a bit of shaping to the arch as well, and the socks are worked in a light fingering weight yarn to decrease bulk from the embossed feel of the
leaves for an easier fit inside your shoes.

Choose a size with approximately 2 inches/5 cm negative ease in foot circumference.

The pattern is written for three colors, but you can use your imagination and use as many colors as you want to make these socks truly unique.

**Gauge:** 40st and 48 rows to 4”/10cm in slipped stitch colorwork
	*Note: a lightweight sock yarn is essential to meet 		 
        gauge for this design.* 

**Construction Notes:** 
The Flea Circus socks are knit top down with a twisted rib cuff, eye of partridge heel, and a rounded toe. I suggest beginning with a Twisted German Cast-on to give you a stretchy cuff that will not flare. The cuff is followed by an increase row before beginning the colorwork leg. This is designed to give the sock a snug cuff before adding additional stitches to accommodate for the colorwork leg and foot. A set of decreases at the toe ensures a proper fit when switching back to single stranded stockinette after completing the colorwork. This design is written for magic loop, but it can easily be knit using DPNs or small circumference circulars. All stitch patterns are charted only.

**Sample Info:** 
Green sock sample shown is Size 3 for a US Women’s Shoe Size 10.5 with 10.25 in (26 cm) foot length, 6 in (15 cm) leg measured above the heel, including a 2 in (5 cm) cuff. White & pink sample shown is size 2 for a US Women’s Shoe Size 7 with 8.5 in (21.5 cm) foot length, 6 in (15 cm) leg measured above the heel. The foot, leg, and cuff measurements are knit to fit; adding length in these areas will increase the yardage needed.

The Dotty slip stitch pattern uses only one color per round, and the carried floats across the back add an extra layer of warmth and cushiness. 

At the gusset, the top of the instep can be worked in either the Dotty stitch, or a two row stripe pattern. You can use magic loop, two circulars, or double pointed needles to knit these socks. 

Choose your size by foot circumference; you can make the cuff and foot as long or short as needed.

Those moments of refuge – often accompanied with knitting, a cup of tea, and music – do wonders for the soul. 

In appreciation and thankfulness for those quiet afternoons, these socks receive their name. They are, themselves, much like those afternoons: gentle and beautiful. Based on an eight-stitch repeat with twisted stitches worked every other round, I recommend knitting this pattern using a solid or tonal yarn to show the stitches as they sway from round to round.

Many thanks to Gemma Thompson (gemmabelle here on Rav) and the Accessible Patterns group for their guidance in formatting patterns in a more accessible way.

Seaward flow is one of the factors that contributes to the mixing of fresh and salt water in tidal estuaries. We’re lucky enough to have two estuaries here in Ventura, one at the mouth of the Ventura River and one at the mouth of the Santa Clara River. They’re ecologically sensitive habitats, but if you follow the posted signage and stay on marked pathways, you can visit and watch all sorts of wildlife. We’re big fans of the egrets and herons.

The tiny overlapping cables on these socks remind me of the way the water in the estuaries ripples as the wind blows across its surface. They’re also meant to mimic the mixing of water in the estuaries, where heavier salt water flows into the river mouth below the fresh water flowing out from the river. The German short-row heel is not one I use often, but it felt right for this project. I hope you enjoy it.

I have colorwork options for 2 accent colors, 3 accent colors, or 6 accent colors - you can get as creative as you like and the possibilities are endless! 

This pattern features written instructions for a German Short Row Heel (although your preferred heel can be substituted), and is worked from the cuff down. 

The yardage for this pattern is available in the photos section, taken directly from the pattern so you can accurately plan your colors! I used 6 colors in this sample, using The Paradise Sock Set from Moonglow Yarn Co (her sock sets that she dyes would be perfect for this pattern!)

Any Superwash Merino/Nylon Sock yarn in fingering weight would work well for this pattern. 

Level: Intermediate - knitter should be very comfortable with knitting colorwork stitches and concepts as well as lace and sock shaping techniques. 

Sizes: To fit (foot circumference: Small (20 - 22 cm/ 8 inches), Medium (23 - 24 cm/ 9 inches) , and Large (25 - 26 cm/ 10 inches)
Note: Small size is shown on model, who normally wears a ladies' 6.5 - 7 US Shoe Size. For Medium US Shoe size 8 – 9, and Large for 10 - 11.

Gauge: 
36 sts by 42 rounds = 4 inch/ 10 cm square in stockinette in the round
34 sts by 42 rounds = 4 inch/ 10 cm square for colorwork

Needles: US Size 1/ 2.25 mm, 9 "" / 22.5 cm circular/ DPN’s / Magic Loop OR size that meets gauge
US Size 2/ 2.75 needles for colorwork (if you find your tension is tight)

Note: The pattern is written according to stitch count and in relation to stitch markers –this means you can use any tool/technique for making your socks that you prefer. Also note, that if you decide to use 9 inch circular needles, that you will need DPN’s for closing the toe.

**OR approx:**
Yarn A: 65 (75, 90, 100)m / 70 (80, 95, 110) yds
of DK-weight yarn.
Yarn B: 95 (110, 135, 155)m / 100 (120, 145, 170) yds of DK-weight yarn.
Yarn C: 95 (110, 135, 155)m / 100 (120, 145, 170) yds of DK-weight yarn.
Note: Yarn estimates are based on a sock foot length of 22 (24, 27, 29)cm / 8 1⁄2 (9 1⁄2, 10 1⁄2, 11 1⁄2)"". You may need more or less yarn depending on foot length. For the best fit, knit socks 1cm / 1⁄2"" shorter than actual foot length.

**Gauge:** 27 sts & 30 rounds = 10cm / 4"" over stranded colourwork on 3mm needles, after blocking.

**Needles:** 3mm / US 2.5 knitting needles suitable for working small circumferences in the round Always use a needle size that will result in the correct gauge after blocking.

**Notions:** 4 stitch markers (including one unique for beginning of round), scrap yarn, tapestry needle 

**Notes:** Thulite are worked from the top down in all-over stranded colourwork, with large, bold blocks of colour on the front and back. The background colour changes once per side, which creates a dramatic patchwork effect when viewed from the side. The socks also feature half-twist ribbing and a mock short-row heel. The DK-weight yarn is knit at a dense gauge to make a thick, cushy fabric. Make sure to keep floats loose and catch floats every 3 sts to keep colourwork tension even and for a comfortable fit (so you don’t get your toes caught). The sample is knit with yarn C held dominant throughout all colourwork sections. Some knitters may find it helpful to place markers between each motif repeat for the charted colourwork section. All slipped stitches are slipped purlwise unless otherwise noted. Some knitters may find they need to go down a needle size to achieve gauge for the heel and toe sections.

For Labor #6: The Stymphalian Birds, we challenged ourselves to learn a new cast-on. We learned the Estonian Double Start Cast-On, and I accidentally cast on the wrong amount of stitches, rather than starting again, I took it as a sign to “make it work” hence the Thiccules Socks were born. The socks are quick and easy knit with just a little bit of mock-cable detail to keep it interesting.
