## Background
---
[Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/) is a social networking platform, library, and organizational tool for fiber artists.  Pattern designers can also promote and sell their patterns through Ravelry.  The website opened in 2007 and is free to use.  As of 2022, over one million patterns have been released on Ravelry.  If you are a fiber artist, chances are you have heard of Ravelry.

## Problem Statement
---
Ravelry has a massive pattern database and over 11 milllion users as of 2023.  Choosing a new project can be daunting for fiber artists and lead to decision fatigue.  A recommender system which suggests similar patterns based previously enjoyed patterns can make the process more enjoyable.  Fiber artists would be more willing to purchase patterns when the process of selection isn't overwhelming.

This project attempts to create a content-based recommendation system that suggests five similar patterns to one that a user enters.  The user can click on the generated URL to go to the Ravelry pattern page for more details and download.

## Analysis
---
A total of 14998 patterns were collected from the Ravelry database.  They consist of 5000 patterns from each of the following garment types:
* Beanies & Toques
* Mid-calf Socks

4998 patterns consist of pullover patters. Two of the pullover patterns each had single unique yarn_weight values and were removed.

Ravelry stores patterns written from designers all around the world.  In an effort to not overwhelm the Ravelry API and to keep the project within scope, I chose to pull 5000 most popular patterns per garment type.  They were further filtered by knitting patterns written in English from the USA.  Discontinued patterns were excluded.

Null values were addressed as follows:
* 'gauge' values were filled based on the 'yarn_weight' feature.  Yarn weight have typical gauges which is outlined by the [Craft Yarn Council](https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system).
* 'max_yardage' values were calculated based on average max_yardage values of garment/yarn_weight combination.
* 'notes' feature filled with 'notes not provided'
* 'price' feature filled with 0.  Patterns without a price can be downloaded free of charge
* 'gauge_divisor' feature filled with 4.0 as the majority of gauges on yarn are given as stitches per four inches


SpaCy was used as the natural language processor before modeling the data.
* [Text Classification using Python SpaCy](https://machinelearninggeek.com/text-classification-using-python-spacy/)
 * [SpaCy Tokens](https://spacy.io/api/token)
 * [Natural Language Processing With SpaCy in Python](https://realpython.com/natural-language-processing-spacy-python/#lemmatization)

FuzzyWuzzy was used to account for user input typos and a method for making a best guess on which pattern a user might be looking for.

[FuzzyWuzzy](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy/)

'gauge' and 'gauge_divisor' features were used create a new feature called 'gauge_per_inch'.  This feature is a normalized gauge value which is better for the recommender system over the previous two features.

# Conclusion
---
I was able to successfully create a recommender system that returns five similar patterns and their Ravelry links to the user.

To test, I compared my results to Ravely's recommendation system.  Each pattern has a link on the page titled 'People who like this pattern also like...' which reccomends other patterns.

I searched for recommendations using my system and the Musselburgh hat pattern.  This pattern has a overall rating of 4.8, using fingering weight yarn, and written by Ysolda Teague.  The following results were:

|Pattern|Overall Rating|Difficulty Rating|Yarn Weight|Project Count|Project Queue|Author
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Musselburgh**|**4.9**|**2**|**Fingering**|**23805**|**3114**|**Ysolda Teague**
|Hermione's Everyday Socks|4.7|2|Fingering|40897|13612|Erica Luedar
|Turn A Square Hat|4.5|1|Worsted|20280|7239|Jared Flood
|Monkey Socks|4.6|3|Fingering|23277|6087|Cookie A
|Jaywalker Socks|4.3|3|Light Fingering|12389|3919|Grumperina
|Simple Skyp Socks|4.7|2|Sport|11863|5596|Adrienne Ku

The only pattern in which both my and Ravelry's recommender system suggested was Hermione's Everyday Socks. This was my first recommedation and Ravelry's second.  I think this is to be expected since Ravelry has its entire pattern database at its disposal.

Next I tried a pattern I have personally knit and enjoyed called Sipila by Caitlin Hunter.  Caitlin is a prolific knit designer with dozens of patterns available on Ravelry.  This time both my and Ravelry's reccomender were quite similar, only because both systems recommended patterns designed by Caitlin Hunter.  

Finally I tried a pattern titled Brassica because the author only has three patterns published on Ravelry.  This time my recommender did not match any of the patterns that Ravelry recommended. I noticed that all of my recommendations were the same yarn weight as Brassica, but Ravelry suggested more patterns in different yarn weights.

I don't know how Ravelry structures its recommender system.  It may use or weight features differently than my system.  It seems to match nicely when the pattern is from a popular designer, but less so in other cases.  Ultimately I think this is a good started with the data I have.

# Room For Improvements
---
Multiple patterns have the same name.  For example, there are 21 different 'Helga' patterns on Ravelry.  As I was testing the application, I found that patterns that share the same name with other patterns have a '-integer' appened to the end of the URL.  Helga patterns could look like 'helga-5' or 'helga-16' appended at the end of its URL.

After investigating the issue, I discovered a 'permalink' attribute which is the unique string for every pattern.  I would like to integrate that into my API call and then use that to dynamically generate a URL for a pattern instead of my current method.

## WIP Extra Model - Garmet Classifier Using Ravelry Images
---

Three hundred pattern photos were collected, with 100 photos each of hats, pullovers, and socks. Each group was split into 70 training and 30 test photos. VGG16, a pre-trained convolutional neural network known for its simplicity despite being older, was used to create a transfer learning model to predict the three garment classes.

The training set was divided into batches of seven and the test set into batches of three. The model was trained over five epochs, achieving 86% accuracy. However, when tested, the accuracy dropped to 30%, equivalent to random guessing.

Argo made the following suggestions, which I will revisit when time allows. Thank you Argo!

* Instead of 1/255, import preprocess_input from the applicatons.vgg16 library .(aligns better with how they trained their model)
* iImport Global Average Pooling 2D versus Flatten because VGG is a giant model.
* Use a single smaller dense layer of 128 versus two dense layers of 256, again VGG is a giant model already.
* Add a drop out layer (0.5) between dense layer of 128 and final layer of 3.  Normally a batch size of 32 is the norm but with such small data I would try both 8 or 16 for both train and test.
* Set a larger number of epochs (maybe 20?) and use early stopping with val loss being monitored, patience can be 5-10 and make sure restore_best_weights = True. This model will need time to run.
* Use len(train_gen) and len(validation_gen) over floor division to avoid loss of data since you're dataset is so small to begin with.
* If don't care about epoch time possibly import Adam() versus using 'adam' and set learning_rate parameter to 0.00001.
