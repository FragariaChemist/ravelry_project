However, I realized that I would need different max_yardage values for each garment.  A sweater knit in worsted weight yarn takes more yarn to make than a hat.  Instead of making three different fuctions, I thought this would be a good case for a dictionary of dictionaries.  I modified ChatGPT's code into a nested dictionary so that I just require one function to fill max_values for all of my garment types.  That also meant that I could contcatenate all garment type datasets before cleaning."
